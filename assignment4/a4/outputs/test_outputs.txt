You know what I do is write for children, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell the people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or stone clothes, and nobody has never chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a epiphany usually is something that fell in some place.
You just have to turn on the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle of the middle school, in the middle school, Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed every week in the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret, actually.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, and I had a <unk> and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> we have never come to know us.
You could get it to Ohio and please bring that man that you have already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> ovarian cancer, and I'd like you to stand up with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> of her family, because it was needed, because necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save it.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to convince you that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
They put them around to me -- almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall out of glaciers or <unk> the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold themselves up to the end, whereas others can't get them more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated apart and they, in great measure as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts, I'm breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As a eardrum melts a eardrum it releases freshwater rich in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you are from a eardrum I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's very often going to be able to see a <unk> eardrum actually here.
Here they are.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the eardrum and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> from the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the eardrum shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every single baby.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want it to be paid too much at the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of conception.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome comes together to the X <unk>
They both <unk> and you start life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity in my activity going to get two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way the way people are sending out the anatomy -- this is about human bodies and <unk> how they have considered the body fluids. What have the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is the one of an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> to people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins, two people within one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex -- individuals whose physical protocol doesn't fit into the male male bias.
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> embraces a lot of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that is not <unk> in the white or female form.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene from the chromosome and tells the <unk> that we all have in the life of <unk> <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks the <unk> the body doesn't react to itself.
It's the <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high testosterone levels but <unk>
As a consequence, the body is developing in the middle of a typically female course.
When <unk> the baby looks like a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And so often, it's not even until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast cancer, but it doesn't have the period of it, when someone realizes something is happening.
And then they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who has not known its <unk> structure, I believe being a typical woman, most women as I are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with the <unk> of <unk> to <unk>
So sex is a bit complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way can be everywhere.
Another example: A few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sex relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a guy and he had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus glands, which were so active that essentially creating a male hormonal environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormonal component of the hormonal component,
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was in the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, a woman in the inside.
Well, another example of a <unk> case.
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> -- that they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that is happening.
So there are a lot of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that the one of those surgeries are going to be a threat to our social categories.
The system is mostly based on the idea that particular the particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have a <unk> identity -- <unk> being black means to be a black anatomy in terms of historical terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people within a same body.
The highest recent case case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called to wonder: "What test are you going to do to determine whether or <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there's no such a test.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a line between men and women and men and men and women and <unk> are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more goes to science, we have to admit that these categories -- we were thought of these categories -- we thought were categories of stable categories that were going to be used directly to <unk> categories are much more <unk> than they were born.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What did you mean by the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we run in the science we get more and more in a <unk> area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our culture today, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know inside the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to go with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him would put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved on it yet.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract our life from a body and put them into another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the prisoner's dilemma really the death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
You know, these categories are much more fragile than we were thinking about.
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find myself as well as the <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
This is why it happened in <unk> with my parents, <unk>
<unk> were <unk> for me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell them why.
What they did, was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And, as you all remember, what our father was, <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs from the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
It was the idea that the political power was going to be able to go from the head of blood transmitted from grandfather to father and then the son, etc.
The Hippocratic <unk> rejected that idea and replace it by a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game field and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the parents, <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the explanation <unk> and therefore <unk> the concept of power <unk> being transmitted by a <unk> kind of <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were passing the idea of <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement movement <unk>
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women <unk>
Then they came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the Civil Rights movement and saying, "I'm a man."
Again, the color of color that we would go to the <unk> coincidence about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we need to start asking why we keep the certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give you a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should be able to look at anatomy.
I don't want to say that at age five years were supposed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me have a sense of meaning and I think we should be a <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before I time: June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June
Henry, on the other hand, was born in term: June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June 1 1980.
For the fact that I was born three months before Mary was attributed to all three months before Henry -- the right to sex consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because I have a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, by virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered to be a <unk> of the wisdom that Mary doesn't have to worry about it.
Mary. I don't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in every single states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So there are still <unk> categories, which in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science goes down so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time I feel like science is broken.
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people have caught in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided to marry a man with a man -- you don't have to have a chromosome and to marry a woman -- you have to have the y <unk>
Now, in practice they don't do testing testing to people.
But this is also very strange to given the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> "I love <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good."
But in practice, how do you do that?
How do people judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to think about it to empower people, because I've to admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> who are probably worth more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more decisions and intelligent <unk> about their sex relationships that I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me would ask what would happen if the character of one person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that America is still driving this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense for democracy and I think we're going to make a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian thing that a man who feels attracted by other men is to be <unk> unless they are willing to vote for a sex change in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm happy to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon who spoke a couple years ago that had done a couple of years ago that had done to light <unk> <unk> and then <unk> and <unk> his fame.
But when he asked the phone, he asked the point of operation was a very <unk> operation, he told me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum rather than <unk> <unk>
America provides huge possibilities for people to be who are without <unk> to change the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, to conclude, I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what it would be, or as it might have been, if we had been, if we had given greater participation at <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit about a <unk> for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking at sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know from <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I was considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about feminine <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to be able to get rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing feminine in <unk>
But the more I thought about your question -- more than there is something feminine <unk>
I mean, that there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people in the state of the state, it's possible to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have <unk> the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we make democracy beyond the <unk> thinking less in the individual body in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect population, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where to go live and work, have the chance to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that they don't count with one city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you never thought about new cities.
But they simply ran through the buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of the people who wanted to live in apartments were already owners, and that the other half still will not have to do it.
You could try to increase the <unk> capability in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we're going to have is that those buildings and the areas that are surrounding them to avoid the <unk> and the building <unk>
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, build a building of apartments totally new, always and when the rules of that place will be building the construction instead of putting it <unk>
So I proposed that governments will take new reform areas to contain large enough to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 <unk> they will come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the following <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like standards to <unk> and usually the standards that prevent us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a bond with the <unk>
I showed you to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about valuable that cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I was called, and he told me we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk again about four and five of January.
So I presented with another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which was about explaining that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that was measuring by at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can provide new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city that might be able to go into <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of <unk> government would need help from countries -- they could benefit from the countries associated with us to establish and make the <unk> standards so that everybody could trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily <unk> a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, January of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow us to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just passed through this crisis <unk> the voting in favor of this constitutional thing was <unk> to one.
All of them are all the <unk> in society, <unk>
In the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed over again in a blind <unk> to one.
After the voting after the voting on the age of February, a <unk> shifting is to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new <unk> center of the city that's building in Korea -- it's bigger than the Boston center in Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years was getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this in a practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow managers to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the court of the last way to this new system of <unk>
There are urban <unk> and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've already solved is that they have a good number of residents.
There are many companies who wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say that they would like to change another place.
There's a million dollars a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to get a job to get a work, sometimes they have to win the money for just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet with their parents that have not seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What seems to be thinking about insist that the families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you <unk>
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a <unk> public confession -- and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photograph and publish my <unk> and colorful and different time for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I'm going to go to know people <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my size?
I would like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
<unk> on exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I wanted to use after getting to <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman who walks at TED in underwear --  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure not using new clothing.
Let's start on Sunday.
This is a brilliant tiger call.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always can see you absolutely for less than 50 dollars.
All the whole together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing that I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just get you <unk> you will also be surprised.
<unk>
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to be a <unk> or I remember her little <unk>
I like <unk> and saying, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, there's no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The gold <unk> are all right.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it again and again when people approached me this week just by what I was doing, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously, this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave a certain thing back there.
I don't need to <unk> these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I go.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical
This would be someone who's totally intuitive.
So where does your brain look at this scale?
Some people are going on one of these extremes, but I think that for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like -- with a great <unk> in both of them <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most other quantum physicists <unk> we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We set ourselves to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is that one thing that says one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, it always was <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar in the parking lot, he taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow them to get them and stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with a criminal bars play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- how they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
And at that point there was the physics of the <unk> you need of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and perhaps it's because it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles still are the principles of quantum mechanics, then I should not all track the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't have been.
And so I felt much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that it's been in a quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then we do a very good approach, the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal, a little bit of springboard and <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost as much as you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip, and I put all the great machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this hole in a swimming hole that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of silly things, but then when other people will get away from doing those things, because I don't want them to hear it, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> of <unk> objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> the <unk> and the wind that happens to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to leave all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
And then we put up the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled all the air out, and then they put it back at a temperature of less than a degree above the absolute zero.
Now, when you're going to be in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, was vibrating. And the way it was going to be <unk> was like a breath in this way -- as a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and that didn't go to the same time -- something that only happens to quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is this is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up to the top and down.
It's just at certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time, they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means the whole metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my piece of logic that I'm talking about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you get your consciousness if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we did, and we turned the lights on, and we looked inside the box, we saw the metal just there on one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It is that those connections, your connections to all the things that you do, literally define you who you are. And that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And I was 18 months old at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head who is here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 and 18 months.
And so many negotiations and stories, it was <unk> with a very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories from why we did.
I think my own story explains just this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I had no access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Now that shows the demo of demo to then you can explain a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> -- Van <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite one, the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click on and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move around and get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the top, and one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, you want to go in the end of the hall,
They continue to go ahead and get <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I've not come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information of <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see things fun that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
And I found that the kids were actually playing with something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on top of <unk>
And it seems very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further into the depth and you'll see that you can actually reach the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going quickly to jump again at MoMA, in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how they Van <unk> actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the night -- I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very easy, we walked -- I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just made a look.
This is <unk> <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, you send them to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when I contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice for your artwork and it's represented properly online.
And the great question that you do today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
You think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this photo, I'm from Italian origin all the children in Italy grow with this photo in the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the spending of 2003, one in the last two decades.
At some time, if you wanted to win a career of Formula one, I would take a budget of Formula 1, and I would take a <unk> to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what in engineering, it will be <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're going back to the outdoor computers.
And, as <unk> are starting to respond in a different way and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
More than cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the end of the <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms were going back and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction as humans -- we have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old <unk> dream.
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it into the Moses -- you can still see a little dent in the <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk> and he said, "Why not <unk>
Well, today, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> insisting on the idea of getting the environment and push it.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup the World.
Maybe some of you remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at activity happening in the net.
Here is the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The line of time is on the top.
At the early afternoon, there are people here and there doing call <unk>
You start with the silence.
<unk> of France.
<unk> people do a call fast and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, <unk>
That night everyone went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the great summit.
The next day they were all at the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and we use.
Today we know all about the source of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the garbage in its shift through the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago to tag what they were doing, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of us will be able to see.
Then we put them a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening things complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> not disappears, which is still somewhere on the planet.
And that if the plastic bottle we <unk> a day still is there.
So if we showed it to people, then we'll be able to promote some change from <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is push on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question from the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public space in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology be able to do, the new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> valves <unk> and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels to be written in them, I'll show patterns, images, text.
And then the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
She liked it very much.
And we would have a commission to design the building to the input of <unk>
We call it a <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors and no windows, but when you get to come up with it opens up so that you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, as in this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all of the architecture disappears.
Here it is.
It looks like people who are going on inside the inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to <unk> when you test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened once when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more <unk>
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It wasn't a building that would be opened for you -- but a building that followed <unk> and holes in the water, and you had to jump up to <unk>
And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, designers, always think about using people to give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of water, and from projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, that moves in other in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud,
It's kind of a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what it changes is light, not the position of the night.
You can play with a different type.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and size, in different types of resolution.
And then the whole thing could be a cloud of a 3D pixels to the one that you can get, and you can see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light goes on, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with one entry that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dance dance today, the star from the New York City star and the <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use it as input to the <unk>
So here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left, you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so digitization in real time in real time as it capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go around the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment to do something and change our <unk> environment like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of it a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama Obama campaign we can move from the digital world, from the <unk> power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this might be able to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or the CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the <unk> world.
The idea is that we can make people care about doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but he covered with the pixel away.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, serve to share the major moments of the Olympics of 2012, and even more, and can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky like something that you can go up as a new top of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a lot of changes in their genes, they could better improve it by a more accurate and faster and faster.
Or maybe I'd like to be in better ways, to be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure about ourselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who were always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most thing that they <unk>
What if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are going to do creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> I probably owe the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many <unk> <unk>
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe is that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED Conference today, but I want to give you a look at a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called <unk> in biology makes sense of the light of <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
refers to other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well in one end, it is, of course, the one we care about.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the time we've been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we are far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in the most of the most basic basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> that comes out of the pancreatic
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the more bacteria that the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- you know, when Antonio <unk> raises the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm -- it's pretty <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that can be able to want without an effort of their part.
It's really like a fast pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some <unk> to the output.
But so on, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they're essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we care about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something probably better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast Federal symphony, in this universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single single <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk -- so I hope you've got it <unk>
When I was just <unk> I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by <unk> and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental to me most fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell is <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two two cells.
But when organisms appear -- things start to change.
The sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one could say that the <unk> of the body is going into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, <unk> death by <unk> it seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hit your front door to your front door.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a little <unk> <unk>
He looks at him and says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
I don't. He says, George, I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to get us healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of going through the genome to the next <unk> we adapt and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall to the sea.
I think we all had the feeling that expressed Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my job.
I want to warn you, not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily lead to longevity.
It doesn't necessarily benefit to the biggest or the strongest or the most intelligent or even the smarter.
Evolution benefits the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, empty fish to the <unk> yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we look back to think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look at it at the bottom stage, I would say that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the question of thinking that it would be that through medicine, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and written out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've <unk> our environment to be adapted as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation isolation that evolution.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of the natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> of the <unk> planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce natural nature.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing and intriguing and terrifying possibility of terrifying and terrifying and frightening.
The call <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to individual and family level.
Just think that if it was possible to be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic interfaces for cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating <unk>
You don't want to do those changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and he sued 13 years.
<unk> billion dollars.
When I finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of 20,000 and a week of a week.
Not that much for us to actually do the human genome for <unk> and becoming more and more in order for all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect them but they're going to induce other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial that has the vaccine against the flu vaccine in a plant of tobacco plants.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today, and in the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two little <unk>
They can change the cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and giving their children a better chance of a healthier life -- eliminating diabetes, eliminating the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> <unk> that same motor of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases are going to allow us to make a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get it to the next generation of the <unk>
Why don't you have a faster <unk> muscle that lets us run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of pass this next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take a thousand years, and we can take it back to 1,000 years, and perhaps within the next hundred years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or our grandchildren from their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these options in order for a better society, more successful, more successful society.
Or, we're going to choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face with.
And the deepest thing about all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for evil, and before what I could do is that these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing I could talk to you with flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already taken the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot is <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
It's not the way.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words <unk> that has heard before.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more about the flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to come and didn't do, all the fences that I wanted <unk> all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I was a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that way, has really changed my life.
And the second thing I learned that day -- and this is while I ran the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity too, I gave my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that we were thinking about things that didn't work with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock goes <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, die not scary.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell you, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a little kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
And at that point, I got to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal that I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And the gave of gave me another gift that was the chance to look at the future and go back and live in a way.
You who are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that you can do it on your plane -- and please not be like this -- but imagine, how do you <unk>
What is the thing that <unk> you still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How could your relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to her home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> is complete <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation company, so obviously the graffiti is a bit <unk> we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he is able to communicate for me."
And I said, "A second is not that you saw Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate by those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're an important person and having a very good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Someone to see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they are doing with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented myself with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that he signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I stayed with his brother and his father there on that very moment, <unk> OK, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk -- we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it is ridiculous that someone who has so much in your inner can't be able to get it.
So I talked to a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research, which have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then, with a laser pointer you draw on that and record negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with sexual organs, then with bad words, then with the <unk> <unk> and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of <unk> and a lot of moving the things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of insurance companies, and we got a machine so that I could get to <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's more <unk> I call him <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is great."
The other thing that we did was bring seven programmers from all the <unk> world from all the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage garage and programmers and programmers and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we would do something completely stupid and that when <unk> would have taken the frames from the walls and they would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went down to the <unk> ride from my son -- my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> <unk> that we bought on the Wikipedia <unk> Beach, kind of copper copper and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on a light light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it's free -- we published the code <unk> the software goes down for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There is no hospital that I can say, "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the other person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after more than a year planning, two weeks of teaching them in the entire night, Tony went back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the car parking lot of the hospital.
And he came back to drawing her family in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti too.
At the end of this he was sent to us an email -- and this was what we were saying, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and they would get me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
And in a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it is the equivalent of a beautiful <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to figure it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were <unk> "Oh, this is great."
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in the center of Los Angeles -- there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show, which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that doesn't possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything of this room.
I'm not a programmer, I had never done anything with recognition technology -- I just recognized something and I had wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want all of us to do all of the days when we find something that we feel that you need to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in the past very difficult time and at the same time a lot of dangerous time.
I went to <unk> difficult.
I worked in a French <unk> mine.
It shows in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just a lot of -- fun in the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard it or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk> <unk>
And I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been this: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about what it is and according to content could be made in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good chance.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me about a year ago, I had no longer been able to be able to afford it for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working, we looked at the world of marketing, <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done with me for something that was so hard or so dangerous to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that comes from the <unk> of product -- the marketing and the advertising, and the whole film is <unk> with <unk> of <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest movie <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all up at the bottom, in early early early on, has pictures of brand, all the time -- from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the brand <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more by <unk>
Was it <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X brand in the title -- but we're going to make sure that all of the categories that we could on the film.
Maybe you have a shoe -- and it becomes the most cool shoe that you are."
The most great car that you've driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink of <unk> <unk> of "The largest movie <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show the brands as part of showing the brands as part of the life, making them <unk> the <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the whole idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear you -- this is the ultimate respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it's going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're going to do it -- it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Don't <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million and a half million <unk> I think it's going to be hard to meeting with them but certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie goes to us, we see it as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or for me.
JK: Both things.
MS: That means you're not really optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where he go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly gone.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything to this project.
And it was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, it was to introduce the product to so many people as possible, make so many people as possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the raw media, is not the idea to tell you with that new vehicle worthy of attention that will lead to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
It wasn't such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for <unk> images on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that are introduced.
I like your <unk> Sergey -- No.
This is the problem: The <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily detected or easily detected or easily detected or easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line probably the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But suddenly when it's trying to make it something changes something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear still continues to be <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this strange rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
They had a <unk> of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want to tell you that you have <unk> history.
We want you to take a story, but we want to make a story -- <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would get me in some lie in some lie -- and there he is looking at me as I used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that's just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, and I would have to take out of the <unk> and go to companies myself with my team.
So what I started to figure out, and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who do big, huge, giant films and others who do small movies like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood Hollywood movies say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who do independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant <unk> movies.
And the film is called "The largest movie <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point during an interview with someone I can say, "You're good for this <unk>
You ready? You see a little anxious.
I want you to help you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> solid, <unk> <unk> like it.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
They were going to make the kind of smaller movies that we have, we are more well a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Woman: Victorian technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you want to describe in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold, <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep you cool time? Best <unk> more <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about a common <unk>
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: So my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothing.
Woman: Put the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's day of <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> brand <unk>
<unk> Something else is <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the brown colors, a lot of things like that.
Normally I carry your tracks like sunglasses, or I like <unk> and the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: I could call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In a <unk> part of a <unk> part of <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet guy.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little <unk> that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because they were <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> <unk>
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk> brand.
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand Tom, but I often joined the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
AT: Tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of self.
MS: These are making the way to see the world.
(Music: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world where people are around you, your friends, your family, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All of those things come together, and they start in a place and in my case in my case in West Virginia.
Or what is the next thing you want to talk to <unk>
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
AT: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your <unk>
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things, I like weird things.
Was I talking about <unk> for what is that?
What is the <unk> What is the <unk> What's now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be scared -- what kind of rollercoaster rollercoaster is.
MS: <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience, <unk> Uncle <unk> Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness for all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only going to get into one of their strong points or on the other instead of focus on both.
A lot of companies tend to avoid the things that are not <unk> and avoid the fear of the things that are not <unk> and you are actually giving them <unk> and you make it become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
There are now <unk> and brands -- those things that have gone and come up with a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: Is a <unk> brand, which is your <unk>
If someone asks you to raise your identity of brand, your brand, and what would that be?
Are you a <unk> attribute -- you are somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or are you more well a attribute <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or audacious or audacious like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystic or <unk>
Or are you more of the <unk> <unk>
Are you <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
Are you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Are you <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> safe, <unk> <unk> or wise <unk> like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mainly because they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we came up to tell the story in this film in how now we use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of the desire in the brain as well for commercial marketing in film.
We went to St. Paulo to San Francisco, where the advertising in the open.
All over the city over the last five years, there is no <unk> no <unk> no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting on the way in the schools in the schools in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I've had the biggest answer or the ones that I've had more successful are the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> to <unk> they took their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They had it interesting.
Well, since the film was launched in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was launched in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million score in the media for this film.
This covers only a couple of two weeks of two weeks.
That's just in <unk> no press and TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because of almost all the agencies that we talk about to their customers not being part.
I always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks are opportunity.
I think when you get people out of that is pushing them to fail.
I think when you train your employees in the aversion is preparing their entire company to reward them for rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to happen is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we're going forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From one <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And in short, we have to harbor transparency.
Today, more than never a little bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> talk -- the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who were to <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: That's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check for the name of the TED matrix of TED, the Foundation, Foundation, Foundation for <unk> to be applied to my TED care for TED year.
The idea behind the worm <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest active to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we were able to engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- are a completely different technology.
But if we could put an effective virus from Windows in a laptop computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, and we are smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
<unk> enter the gray, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> I used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these systems systems.
So that's called attention, and we started an experiment in which we were looking at our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they had very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that place: right?
If it wasn't, <unk> does nothing.
So that's called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say a <unk> plant plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
They better make the goal soon.
And so we pulled up the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs.
We also saw that they were very professionally very <unk> by people that obviously had all the internal information.
They were all the ones to attack.
They probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you have heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me tell you the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code attack.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks like the old language of <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking for at first were called the system of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to <unk> with the real world with potential targets in the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get theories about goals -- we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> must be a nasty <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
There are no number of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I saw them in an effort to <unk> his experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of <unk>
<unk> is that mobile piece inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in one obvious effort to <unk> the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't get it.
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And he got better yet.
These <unk> are <unk> in Iran in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what did we find in the code.
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in the hands.
And so that hasn't been <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been out of them after several weeks of work hard.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
Yet, we discovered that both of the digital <unk> would be to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very concerned that we've determined what is the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not care about that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw really <unk>
There's the gray, and up the <unk> you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the values of the sensors for example, for example, the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this false data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the safety camera is fed <unk>
Is it great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> at <unk> in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine is happening, you have to open escape valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this cannot be a human operator.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And neither the <unk> and the security system is going to get it.
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a energy plant, or a factory factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a key <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
Could you use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with a lot of goals.
We have to deal with the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower of this.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and I give <unk> abilities or other than making users lawn chairs and come back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're nothing other than something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force that is also giving up your velocity, and help, for example, drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we start talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on your back a <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it's being <unk> to get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- lesions in the back 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage <unk>
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can <unk> 90 pounds per variables for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to get in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of the wheels, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people on the wheels around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens to be very young people, with the backbone of starting their life -- 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is going to be multiply fast.
Her only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I might recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago he had a injury on the neocortical column, and as a result was couldn't go back to walking 19 years now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
Not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to board on board, here on the back.
There's also some batteries that give the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it progress with this soft soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years ago at the top of my life when, for a strange <unk> in the air, <unk> costs <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all of it and all of the <unk> <unk>
Little time later, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never will come to <unk>
That was 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last little bit of hope of my being.
The technology of adapting since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs in <unk> climbing rocks and even ride a <unk>
But they've never invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change your life to future generations -- not only from soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of the wheels, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just went back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, I know the cousins.
This is the world of the <unk> <unk> world.
The bonobos are along with the chimps, their lives in their closest lives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimpanzees are dominated by the big, <unk> guys, the Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the Amazon forest, and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been sustained by decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction is also putting the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting and hunting and the deforestation is able to fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly we're not sure about it.
And yet, in this land of violence and chaos can be heard of the hidden laughter by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes -- <unk> the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the lives of Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
So for us and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, variety of connections of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobos Bonobo sees the roots very much of the laughter, and the dance and the human act.
The game is the glue that we come together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about soccer.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just that I think in this case he love, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as well in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because you know, this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements in the game -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where wonder.
And I want you to tell you, this is <unk> a young woman who is playing with water <unk>
I think that we sometimes play alone, and we explore the boundaries of our interior and outside worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to explore, and then the unexpected connections that we form is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the realization that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world to greater and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let's put it up with the <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans and humans is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate play, they can be the moments when it is the most <unk>
So those primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of a captain in a fire row.
And in our city, where volunteers have a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But still there was a career standing on the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly <unk> one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the end night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in your pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer who had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  he came up to the captain and he asked him to walk and save the dog <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a lot of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who went into a <unk> building to save a live living because I made it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need between the house.
I need <unk> <unk> the fire, and it brings this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, and the end of the hall went to the fire firemen -- that it went to the top of the fire -- and I went into the fourth one for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden around the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog in the front door.
You live from my house treasures for house owner where, as they would expect, his trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house owner of the brave brave to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over the rest was that someone had been achieved even a couple of shoes.
Both of my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as my calling as fireman <unk> I'm a witness of generosity and kindness on a scale -- but also of grace acts and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have succeeded, or are you in the <unk> levels of success I'd like to remind you to you -- I don't wait.
Not wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you pay it now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we are going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So they trained to <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the wall.
The first concrete blocks are built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement modules from a fixed measure that fit with each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges or a brick at the same time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> he came up with this.
He called it <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful, buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
And I just adopted the concrete block of concrete in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that single year, at the labs labs the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> stacked on a world where everything was interactive.
Like the block of concrete, the transistor allows to create much bigger and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't believe it that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they aggregate through magnets.
So you can't place the wrong way.
The bricks have a gene code.
The green is the <unk> the current, <unk> is the input and the orange is the <unk>
So you just have to assemble a blue thing with a green one, and very quickly you can start to do larger circuits.
A blue with a green is making light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse module that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
And we had this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it <unk> faster or slower -- just a button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing record.
We want all of the interactions in the world <unk> to use it to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels -- everything has to be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does it work? You know, a light overnight, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design design schools.
So for example, designers have no experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>   A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of Rhode Island, which has no expertise in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, <unk> something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> barrel for movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be aware of it.
So <unk> has open source.
You can see the website, download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and make up.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is getting involved in the environment and focusing on the environment.
collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
Can you take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm going to play this time.
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to be asked to work in government.
The initiative is <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a few <unk> of Peace <unk>
They were a few members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of them to the Third World we send them to the wild world <unk>
They did great <unk> they worked with <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> to <unk>
It's a <unk> in Boston.
Here it appears as if I could find a quote, but what really looks for is that someone has been caught when it's trapped by the snow because it knows that it's not very good at building fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask the help of this way <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, I was very much given last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> the sidewalks in front of them.
So he made a good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
So when you do that, you put a name, in this case he got <unk>
If you don't do, someone can be <unk>
I mean, there's a component uprising.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 killer applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it stretches <unk>
A responsible for systems of <unk> City, by looking at this app realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to make <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> from tsunami, but people are being <unk>
So he asks the citizens to <unk> them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens.
And Chicago was just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that are using using using it.
And this has been spreading without <unk> organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know this doesn't happen.
The acquisition of software takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then we told us that they had done by the normal channels it would have taken at least two years and half a couple of dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the business of California that until the moment has 2,000 billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every government level.
So an app that takes program in a couple of days, and it <unk> in a viral form is a kind of <unk> warning to the institution of government.
It proposes the best ways to work, not as in private companies, like a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather than the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in the open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the issue of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution of an <unk> institution as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to bring together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They have not been given up with the government.
They feel a great frustration of that, but you don't know how to do it.
And this people know something that we've lost from view.
And it is that if we leave aside the feelings about politics, line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that we get together, the government is, essentially, in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because it's alone not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask them to do it because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way to think it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to get <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the center of <unk> and information.
It's the place that the calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music, and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> and a mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
I don't know that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happens to get this <unk> <unk> in my trash cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went back <unk> I went home.
Good nights <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the government of government to collaboration civic collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform so that people are <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected two people.
And I could have connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> their communities.
If we call the animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people are doing it, but you think one is the entry of the other.
That our input to government system is vote.
How many times have chosen to a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will save our values and we have our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But this is that <unk> what keeps us to do that is that we funded as something that is working on our against, that other thing, and in a result, we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we'll have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real government work.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk>
This is a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not a political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> in the government, is time for us to ask what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do without government, we need it to be more effectively.
The good news is that with technology is possible for the root to root the governance function so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> only to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I, to <unk> I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everyone will speak.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem, they don't care about a lot to do their voices.
They're using hands.
They bring their hands into the work to program applications that make the work better for the government.
And those applications allow us to use your hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning a <unk> by taking away a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
We were always able to have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that; we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all of us are going to be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a swarm <unk>
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED and hearing these stimuli has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I notice in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here are impact on the world.
On some occasions, if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
So here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we have learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard it was strong, it was strong, I had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in West Virginia.
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit, and I looked at her, she was approaching me and gave me a good <unk>
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then I was shocked.
One or two hours later, I would go back to <unk> and I was like, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I was going to get me back again, and if I said yes, I gave me in peace.
I had this human quality that made you always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
On some occasions, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to catch her time and her attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I woke up in the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at her, and she was really serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and he came up with my hand and said, "Come <unk> <unk> We are both going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
He took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, I am."
She said, "Now I was <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you do?
I will never forget it.
Then he said, "I want you to ask me about three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to ask you, is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I was inspired by my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> -- so I <unk>
Then he said, "The second thing I want to tell you is that you're always going to be going to be going to be the right thing to be the right thing to be <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I would do it."
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want to tell you is that I would never be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> -- so I <unk>
I grew up in the field, in southern rural. I have a brother a year older and a sister a little boy.
When I was 14  15, a day my brother got home with a package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> took us to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just get to do the <unk>
He took a laugh of beer, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. You do it -- you <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. Don't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And he looked at me with force and <unk> "Oh, not to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't mean this thinking that it's a <unk> I say that because the power is about identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to the others who don't really make sense.
We can't get them to do things that they can't do to do.
I think my grandmother did naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My guys died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was about 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest <unk> rate of the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor or black communities are so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of every three black men in the 18 and the 30 years is in prison, or in parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Baltimore and Washington, from 50 to 60 percent of all young color in prison, or in parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a criminal system that makes you much better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is going on the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not trouble ours.
Are we <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in our work -- some of the developments as well.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states, you refuse to care by always if you have an criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years, the level of the loss of rights to be as high as it was before they were before the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where <unk> children are going to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, no chance to go out.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in death row.
This issue of death row is interesting.
In a sense, we have moved to thinking that the ultimate question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crimes of <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one that is innocent and released from death row.
<unk> <unk> <unk> a innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation a aviation would not be able to be able to fly airplanes if every nine to <unk> one would be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on American history, I'm talking about slavery, <unk>
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted until the Second World War.
We really don't know much about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a defined bit of terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are older people who are coming up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you honor talks, and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you say, <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our history, we deal with terrorism.
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was, obviously, with segregation and decades of competition and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time I would do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about <unk> I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that it couldn't be <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany, leading on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's good disturbing to listen to what you do?
<unk> We have no death row in Germany.
<unk> we will never be here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There's no way that we have in our history, we can never get into the systematic state of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> we were to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How do we feel like a world where a nation like Germany, we will save people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we really don't care about these issues, the positive and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by the technology that we have <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate all things.
And lately we talk about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the ones that never come to TED.
So thinking about them is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. Even though it's so rational, so committed to the intellectual,
So with innovation, with creativity. The development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection to mind with heart is what drives you to not just how bright and <unk> but also in the dark and hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is virtually at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There's no related disconnect with technology and design, that will allow us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> inequality, by injustice.
Now I want to show you that these thoughts are a much more challenging identity than we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege -- being a very young lawyer from meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to speak.
Occasionally, the <unk> <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. I do."
So she was like, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
And so I was going to go and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, <unk> Give me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
And we try to help those who have been convicted <unk>
We try to confront <unk> and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk> freedom for the kids.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population on prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and I was looking at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got me in my face and said, "This is why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is superior to the worst thing we have <unk>
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't blame him, it's not that it's a <unk>
But even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity of people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology, because of our intellectual and intellectual ability to be.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not in the way they deal with the rich and powerful rich, but the way they treat the poor, <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound themes about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much <unk>
<unk> tired of all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my <unk> customers and 14 years old, who have been <unk> for them as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge to turn someone into what it doesn't it?
The judge was going on as a adult, but I see a boy.
One night, I was awake at the end of my God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer -- a little poor poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> <unk> to be treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> I put that there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the power of police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country, there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking about that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only the <unk> but I had sent it to the cut.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And eventually I got to go for God, I have to go to court for this guy.
I got on the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. I walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you. I said yes.
And then I came up with me and <unk> me.
And I'm going to tell me about the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
It connected deeply with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a hope.
Well, I went into the <unk> room.
When the judge came in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk>
People started to go. They were all <unk>
I was the one who had written those <unk>
They got the policemen <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. All right, because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye to see the <unk> that I was going to go and <unk>
I would look at the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black black black came in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break one <unk> <unk> he showed up because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black <unk>
He said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, he looked at me and said, <unk> this audiences room to tell this young man who would keep his view in the aim of <unk>
I've come to TED today, because I think a lot of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds toward justice.
We cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity and creativity must lead to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of us who share this, I just want to tell you that they are going to keep the view in the target.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Let me hear you hear and see an obvious appreciation for the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several times close to you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which an effort to <unk> the funds that are spending today in policy today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row over the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the cases of homicide not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds to make the law, to the security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who think that's like this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong war war.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to chain <unk> to steal a bicycle, for little crimes against property, instead of making those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've excited about you today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months.
The idea is that the press media. prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second day our senses is getting a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters more than to survive, the first stop of all this data is an old segment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector the <unk> <unk>
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So of a <unk> of stories, <unk> look at the negative.
That old adage of <unk> "If there's blood, you know, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us bad news -- the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder we <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe, instead of change, what really happens is we got <unk>
Maybe the huge progress was done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the <unk> of the species of water and <unk> without any doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long time, we just with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita is <unk> has <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communications has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy has gone from 25 to more than 80 percent over 80 years.
We're really living an extraordinary thing.
A lot of people were doing it.
And we continue to <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, <unk> <unk> television, mobile air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the planet, would never have been dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> technology on the information is jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile thing that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft thing -- in good and bad time -- in war and peace, in recession <unk> and <unk>
It's the resulting computer used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computer in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call infinite computing and the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production on all the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels of vaccines and food, food, digital, digital, <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk> <unk>
It was spade.
I sought the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this this: <unk> <unk> to <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to everyone in your mobile phone.
Four years ago here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year, we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, and that it might affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think of creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> it's about creating a life of the possible.
This is about taking that out of a little bit of moments and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the kind of the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
This is why the top of the Washington Washington is from aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is the Earth's mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as <unk>
It's <unk> by oxygen and <unk>
But then he came up with the <unk> and he made the aluminum something that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about power failure.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about needed, but it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT was published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, it will cost six cents a <unk> compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk now about wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager shuttle into the Earth, in 1990, after I went to <unk>
<unk> a famous photo, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought by the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology that's available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> the <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator <unk>
It's able to generate a thousand liters of water to the day of any source -- saltwater, fresh water -- a <unk> by less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which it will be, Coca-Cola is to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology today.
And we've seen it in mobile.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent of the mobile penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan is 25 years ago.
And from having an intelligent cell with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information than the president Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever since.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> video images, images of books and music, high-tech technology, <unk> technology, and lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing about it is when it comes to your health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to bring these technologies into a mobile device where you speak, and because it has <unk> they can be extracted from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics than a medical team team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers.
When this device would be called a RNA virus or DNA virus that will not be able to call the <unk> and the first place, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the highest force of producing a developing world.
I call it the <unk> of the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just had the mark of the seven billion billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, which we had been connected.
By 2020, it will go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds have never been before that we add to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you do? What wishes you <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent the tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health care about the <unk> of a better education with the Academy Academy and because of the use of 3D printing and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three billion more of the members of human humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about a voices never before <unk>
What if we give you the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and could be able to act for the first time?
What did these three billion?
And if they are contributions that we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X is that young teams guided by her passion with an obvious goal, of course, they can do things that could only make the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game that people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how to fold up the protein.
The folds determine structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this college professors -- college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came up with each other and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns of human patterns is better folding proteins than best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion different minds that are going to be asked to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have a little bit of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give them three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, on the Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets they still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a water in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I was very much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, about <unk>
There were 20 feet of about 20 feet -- the <unk> of black.
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he was made over the middle in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped down in half.
<unk> at age five.
You have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
They were still happy.
And the fish still were happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of developing projects.
Climate development was to impose to the countries that were already 100,000 <unk> <unk> economic fishing.
And this boat, quite <unk> he called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we went out of studies in southern South China, and mostly in the Sargasso Sea.
So what we capture was a <unk> thing.
<unk> now yes, the bottom of the sea.
90 percent of what we capture were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> these tiny little <unk> of the remains of coral reefs.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing game.
The bottom of being a very solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once capture a alive.
It was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to a place where they never have fish.
But it's not <unk>
<unk> the world, but we didn't remember it.
You know, the point of start to start a new level, not remembering what was there.
If you take this stuff up something like this.
On the axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, a number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do with <unk>
Every generation will use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the succession of changes.
And at the end of the end, keeping a few <unk>
And that, in great measure is what we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer -- or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because of course, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose some <unk> animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on large animals, and in a sea of big fish.
They become little bit frequent because <unk>
And over time, there's a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> which was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, not the way they would expect that to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like a captain of a <unk> and I looked at a lot of fish in this area can't be used -- or usually they don't use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in inorganic societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
So the enormous role that can make a protected marine area.
Because with marine protected areas we actually recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the point of starting is run on, and it's extremely low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine area and can benefit from the vision that we can erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like people in the West, for example?
I think there is the arts and cinema -- maybe you can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that giving, the only one to give, to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we'll see what the videos are made up and how important it does that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when I was younger, that seemed something very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or of our actions, copper animations in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can get famous on the Internet in a <unk>
You get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of a viral percent gets lots and lots and lots of visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities and surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of popularity of summer summer.
<unk> I didn't talk about making a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos in nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I would give the video to the popularity of it.
<unk> trends like Jimmy <unk> present things and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
RS:  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on the end --  -- everybody wants to get on the end of a week, the weekend.   <unk> Friday, <unk> on the Friday, --   won't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> from the Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like <unk> <unk> -- this video seemed to be made out of nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> Science Foundation was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends have embrace a point of view, and they share with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Only in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, unlike the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year, you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
The cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats looking at the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did an old version of the old one.
And then it became international.
Suddenly, I came up with a whole community of <unk> which made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or <unk> Black or <unk> <unk>
What do you want to have written that <unk> this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video days per minute, only that really unexpected and unexpected can be able to make it so that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind of protest against <unk> <unk> in New York City, I admit I didn't really became too much.
Casey <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> but often there's obstacles that prevent you out properly in the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise to the surprise and their humor, Casey <unk> managed to five million see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth everything we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend communities are creative communities to participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of culture, where we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> began on YouTube.
Don't try to express your ideas.
Now we are all a <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's hardly the current media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man is burning the work of a life.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in no avail.
The words, for both time friends, now <unk>
They are <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was tried to be <unk> but I was doing it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother <unk> I was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> task escape her family escape and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat was slid into the sea in the hot ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the toilets, the rape and death.
Like most of the adults -- my mother had a poison.
If we asked first to take it up, we took my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the engine, the <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I know the lights on the back of the platform in front of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I'll end the journey was too much for it; and the first apple I did, given for the men of the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> <unk> whose population is <unk>
Unlike the suburbs of the middle class -- whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English is <unk> between the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a line of cars, working six days, <unk> turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in I.T. <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, you wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> who was usually <unk> it was always <unk>
Two pairs of <unk> for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform to <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
home.
Something of me is <unk>
I was very <unk> and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I was <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we ran over our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> every ship.
And my task was to be awake until the nightmares were going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and it opened another business.
And women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't do the angry transition and <unk> <unk> and <unk> kids caught in between two worlds.
They looked forward and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the moral <unk> student relentless with what I stopped myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> tragically, by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many people had help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer chose the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges aren't <unk>
As a <unk> resident <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist and a <unk> invited talking to sites that I had never heard of, and in houses that she had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for nearly 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now at the same age as she had when we ran onto the ship.
The "no" ever had ever been an option.
<unk> he said, "What are you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly I talked to you -- I was more <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were living in the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a <unk> a new Texas, new on the scene -- and not just it's good, but it's something that is because of what being grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> optimism is rare and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people for whom the motto can't be <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant soup out of soup that all <unk>
They were going to make it well at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
It took the decision to move to the U.S.
And after a journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person he cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
The 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of their husband, it caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to take the cause for her, and so much more <unk> caused when I won it.
The fact that it can't have proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw him standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a few minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple.
We tell stories, and we ensure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came up and said he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from <unk> he said.
"You haven't got it.
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because of those who we were and how life built us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> had easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish for you.
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave <unk> in each wave, the constant rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and you can see it in a particular way.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here today, in the fourth or a fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the old Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with aircraft.
At that time, when the great prince Mark warrior famous warrior -- he had <unk> it took a bow and a <unk> on the ground, you got water.
We do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a great thing to me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I gave up this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a dusk if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't help my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic, not <unk>
When my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of 50 years was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of pirate images, and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had the feeling that mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it to <unk>
We embraced our inspiration.
And so I was reminded of this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books for the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
I put the text with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But why do you do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, "You know, your fingers on each other light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In a number of moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live from GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean wizards and <unk> but to that childhood magic -- to those ideas that are <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we need to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world is turned into a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In the whole book of fantasy there has always been maps but are static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect of me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people out of India know their <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been stuck in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a single infant story.
In a story that involves current issues as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out on the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> <unk> rocks, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this ritual from the childhood has to go out and in a chapter -- a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another one, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the difference of connection between magic, the Earth and technology is there many possibilities.
In the next book we have to have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and through an augmented reality of augmented reality see a <unk> group that appear on the inside of the house.
And at a moment the screen is full of leaves in a moment.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature will relate to technology and magic and technology and technology gets to another.
<unk> power of the sun.
We're close to our children and ourselves to the natural world and that <unk> joy and child love that we felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about why a lot of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop hearing patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University University was <unk> to a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or I asked the patients, family and <unk> What would you do?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that we do, or perhaps not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail to stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob <unk>
Every morning I was hooked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge of getting to 95 percent.
But it's so simple that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time that it needs to be <unk> or some urgency of that way, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I get up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can be able to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week, it will be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were moving from their homes, taking their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share with each other, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to the control and to be driven by their own <unk> but we can also help us care about health care because of the challenges we face as the firing of the costs of attention to <unk> care and other issues.
So techniques that are just simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share it with you with a video with a video.
We all have checks in the <unk>
Maybe we even have them in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATMs <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public audience, you see a <unk> please <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open up in a little <unk> office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 people were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone else can use your iPhone, and the weeks after the weeks of Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> to find the nearest <unk> what can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to show you this one, not only as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to go to the global level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that they help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on holidays and someone else can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> that is shown is still in their place.
Please <unk> in this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
And I mixed with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera and the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that I would start by pressing the <unk>
They were going to show you like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the reality level.
And when I say <unk> I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way as photography.
So let's think that you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what's the trick that makes them seem <unk>
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes illusion is the perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here's three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in combination of some way can create something that still seems like <unk> as if you know.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's move into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a photo seems realistic -- I think they're those in the ones that don't even make the things around us in our everyday life.
But when you combine photographs is very important because otherwise something will look wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to get realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of the photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos have to have the same kind of light.
And these two images do with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of different images with a perfect family.
It has to be impossible to see where the picture.
This is another example.
So you might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is entirely composed of photographs of different places.
In the staff I think it's easier to create a place that is going to find it because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try and find the different locations for the puzzle parts.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing ride.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even made a red number the house on the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to get an realistic outcome, I think it takes a planning for it.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and at the same time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring technology.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anyone who took from a folder myself.
I'm not really interested in showing the details of it but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as many other things that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of <unk>
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> is something new.
Here's something weird happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
It's more <unk> because writing about paper.
Why are we using technological curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve where you say, these are the years, or some unity of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to <unk> the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you ask for example, some other technology, like transportation, a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a change <unk>
If the technology of transportation <unk> as fast as <unk> past night we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development of growth that every few years, advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- looking at these curves <unk> we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
So let's get one of two things.
Or well it's going to be converted into a typical curve, I know how to come up something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
If we now would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, "Well, what is that new way to adopt the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're immersed in it.
I remember a child the future was happening in the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
It's a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at long-term things.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each one billion years.
So we go back a half two two years ago when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemicals we give us a sense of how things came from.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that's that, at that time, there was a few oil <unk> with all kinds of prescriptions in its inside.
Some of those drops of oil drops a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring materials out of the outside and so the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> oil.
But those drops weren't living in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> <unk> a distribution of the chemicals that we had.
That's why each <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow <unk> being better at the time to incorporate the chemical chemists -- more chemists <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
They were usually living longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, very simple life, but things are interesting to be interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
And somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save data, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this particular evolution of writing that allowed them to record what they were so <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> We can just write things with this code.
Here I have a hundred <unk> of white dust that try to hide people from the airport.
But I said, I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and it took it 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing the DNA was an interesting step.
This has made these cells happy, another billion years.
But then it came up with another big step in which things became very different and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way of avoiding penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave you communities that, in some ways, they were together in it, and a <unk>
From that <unk> way, or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community became more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities were approaching so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the board community in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that have communities that are <unk> communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and formed more interesting levels than the cell phone, something that we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
They started to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
It's the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the length of an organism, and not the length of an evolutionary period.
So a organism, for example, learning how to eat some fruits because he knew bad and got sick the last time they ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that before they had been built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned over hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate those fruits of individuals who ate that fruit in.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures that are enormously accelerated by the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea a <unk> idea in your head.
I'm sitting here on emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy to mine.
But we take something very complicated and it turned it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to work as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've started doing <unk>
We now spend through similar periods of <unk> organisms -- our <unk> and <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> the computer tape, the computer tape, the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that now we built to handle that information.
And that brings us together on something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> in which produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that told them took a billion years each.
The following stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
<unk> the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And we've got the <unk> like electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds your own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know the mechanisms that employment for <unk> would not be possible without recent computer technology.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that <unk>
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction -- put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that I didn't could, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately is evolution itself.
So we put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please have a computer, you can run a hundred million requests for chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those who are more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are going to get close to numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the order right.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that did better than <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we want the best to <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children are <unk> the properties of both of those programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
Let's try it again.
<unk> some mutations in it.
And it tries to try and try and get another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in a dark cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that are taking numbers absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
These are weird programs.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I have the security that they achieve because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on doing it.
Once I was on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to provide a <unk> <unk> you don't feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're getting complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering does.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use these programs to make computers much faster and so they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
Are we <unk>
And we are at a analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We're the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we doing.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to us to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of creating whatever it is.
But now it's coming up at lunch and I think I'll stop here before I get off.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've got enough time for letting me give up part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be able to get <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that the bat <unk> got three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the field of game without being <unk> and that whatever it is to be <unk> at the first base of it doesn't get to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know what they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, this is someone that 10 <unk> beat him four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or perhaps less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are <unk> to a surgeon who has also a record record in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place away and a dear person has two <unk> <unk> and your family doctor bring it to a cardiologist whose record is 200 of 200 <unk>
But guess what?
She's getting better this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But they will ask them.
What do you think about the average of the hits from a heart surgeon, or a nurse from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
It's very good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, though, is send them to the world, and I got myself included, with the mandate of being perfect.
You could never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the take-home message when I was in medical school.
I was a fiscal student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood test.
Right?
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> home of Toronto, from Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned everything of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, by anatomy, the origin and the muscle work, the <unk> of each artery that comes out of the <unk> the wild discrete diagnosis, and the <unk>
And even knew the <unk> diagnostic of how we classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> of medicine in medicine with the impression that if you were able to do everything, then would you know everything, or as possible, as close to everything, because it was going to be ashamed of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought to the emergency service in the emergency service where I worked on.
At the time I was assigned to <unk>
And when he asked a cardiologist to go to a cardiologist -- I went to that patient.
They will report the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when <unk> I heard a sound of sound on both sides, which was struck by heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes into the lungs, these are <unk> and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I went to work in the treatment that I was given.
I gave it <unk> and medication for ease with your heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I was very good.
And that was when I made the first <unk> the sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone, and I did what I should have done, he was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to deliver information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that <unk> constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
By the send him to her home, he didn't pay attention to a voice in my interior that was saying, <unk> -- it's not a good idea. Don't do it.
In fact, I was so unsure that he asked the nurse who would give the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I think I'll be okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so he was signed up the high and ambulance ambulance with the ambulance and he took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I kept with my job.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital and walked down to the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that time I did something I don't usually do normally, I did not normally do.
It happened for the emergency service service to the house.
And there was another nurse -- not the one who ran from the lady <unk> before, but another one said to me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors would come from.
Other specialists fear it too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: you remember it.
"You know the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
They said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
As an hour of having arrived at her home, after I had a high collapse and his family had a collapse of the <unk> the ambulance brought the emergency room to the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure pressure on top of 50 feet of <unk> which means a little severe.
I was barely breathing and was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all of their resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and I was hoping for all the hope that they were <unk>
And in the age of two or three days after it was obvious that he never <unk>
He had <unk> brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they were <unk> to what was happening.
And by the ninth day, he left her son, wife, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks after that, I was struck by it and I experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I was just alone, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that did that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I spoke to the family and I'm sure that I was going to get the things and made sure that I didn't give up.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why was he sent to her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little at a little bit of that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day, he opened up the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I felt better again.
And I made a deal with me in the way that if I was going to take the efforts to be perfect for not making more mistakes, I would leave for those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, I was inspired by the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
<unk> penicillin and sent him home.
But while he ran to the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my head asked me to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I gave the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and I had no <unk> <unk>
I had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but of the upper upper pollution, and that can cause the close of those tracks.
He was, fortunately, she didn't die.
You know, antibiotics is <unk> antibiotics and regained the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the emergency turn -- not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> at 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, not the sent home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculus <unk>
It turned out to be an X-ray of it, but it turned out to be normal -- a colleague who was checking out the patient would have some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I looked at it and at a certain sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
Both were operated and they recovered well.
But each case <unk> me <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
And here is the problem: If I can't love it, and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do you show them this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would walk right now to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a cocktail party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- it would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones who make mistakes and the ones that no, the ones that can't sleep and the ones that I know they have <unk> results and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get out of medicine to people who make mistakes, get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical enterprise and mistakes to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Toronto Toronto to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen every day -- where one in 10 drugs will be wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system where infection infections are increasingly and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 24,000 Canadian by <unk> <unk> <unk>
The U.S. U.S. Institute established 100 dollars.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so the things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't care about it.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect record of a chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in my chest, and it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms in the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we took the system like we were <unk> and we eliminated all the professionals likely to error, well, not to be anyone.
And with respect people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art is already a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everyone, from the ambulance to the head of surgery -- <unk> "this is my worst <unk> blah, blah, <unk> <unk> "What are your <unk> And they <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students are going to be able to go back to the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, you didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The magic doctor is human -- you know, it's human, and they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They gave the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but a kind of loving and support and <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they make errors instead of time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human <unk>
And I feel a lot about it, but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to choose a middle American, they're about 70 to a day.
Not a lot, in a research followed for a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks for these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> work for a week.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you look forward to those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choose to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions.
So while I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know their answers.
When you ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for please give a <unk>
And now my first question of day, you're ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student, at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 types of fruits and vegetables and <unk> and 25 of <unk> water, and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was like, why never buy nothing?
This is the shelf from the oil shelf in <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in the <unk> box that came from trees.
Once I decided to visit the manager and I said, <unk> this strategy of providing all of these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses with tourists that were coming every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had a different different types.
They put a post in the front of the store.
We put out there <unk> six <unk> or 24 flavors and we saw two things: First, what case people were willing to stop <unk>
More people stopped when I had a 60 when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
When I stopped when there was only three percent of them to buy <unk>
From those who had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six times as though they found 24.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we will probably be able to get <unk> less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of choices as makes it really affect us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this doesn't happen to us.
Now the theme of the day, financial savings now.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from a million Americans, between about this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money <unk> available for retirement, to retirement, the <unk> program, to save people to save for the future.
And we found that there was actually a <unk>
We had plans that were going from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding -- there was less participation.
So if you look at the extreme extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two <unk> the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 <unk> the rate of participation went down to the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choice, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those that they decided to participate, the more it was the number of choices, more people will be <unk> by avoiding actions or hedge funds.
In terms of more choice, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize the financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three major negative consequences of offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision -- that the <unk> even when this is going against their own interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, in the health.
They are more likely to pick things less likely to pick things less <unk> even though they've seen them better.
The main reason is that we are going to be able to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choosing that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we've done in a way or another, in different research, so you can test it in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually, what we're seeing is that if you choose to cut rid of rid of you out of <unk> <unk> you have an increase in sales, <unk> -- there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> saw 10 percent increase in revenue.
When the Golden Heritage <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that were less than <unk> were raised in <unk> by two major sales and high costs.
You know that at the average of today, in average, they provide 45 products.
In a Walmart store Walmart is about 100,000 products.
But the top nine shop in the current world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle better choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All Harvard employees are <unk> automatically at a safe background of life.
The people who really want to choose, they give them 20 or not 300 or more.
You know often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
These are all options.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience on a vacation with all the world's most beautiful road <unk>
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a hand if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> OK. Anybody who is ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
You actually had more information in the first round, that in the number of the second <unk> but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more <unk>
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be very <unk> very <unk>
Why is people spend 15 percent to 30 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or credit cards than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem to be real money.
It turns out to make it be more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were being held by a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting, we <unk> exactly how we <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we found was that I would give up the staff who would think of the positive things that they would put in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or in what they wanted to put in their <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
So for example, this is a study that we did in a magazine <unk>
And we saw that in the supermarkets -- <unk> along the <unk> <unk> the exhibition shows can contain from <unk> different types of <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two pieces of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This <unk> schematic is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to whom we were <unk> not as the <unk>
And you often see this problem with those big funds.
Who are you supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can handle a lot more information than we think, if you just get it a little bit.
We need to increase gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a very good decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions.
We have 56 possibilities.
You know, <unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is to vary the order that the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from a lot of options, 56 colors, two colors, a few hundred boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from a few choices, four to 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you <unk> the defect in every decision, this is that they are <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that those who are going from a lot of choices to days -- <unk> the default button over and again, and another one.
<unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which information is presented with information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the pick of changes would not tell you anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've been talking about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> eliminating alternate alternatives -- <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced were designed to help drive the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own issues, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to <unk>
And the more careful how the more careful we can do to do the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in the East Germany, East Germany, if you had a writing machine to write out of the government.
I had to register a sheet of text of an example written with the machine.
And this is so that the government could track the origin of texts.
If they found a written script with the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't conceive that someone could do this, the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer of any larger manufacturer on each page that you follow a pattern that makes them one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems on the Web.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are actually a lot of <unk> online <unk> <unk> that would be money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthieu Anderson, etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by <unk> banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret secret service is two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this one has <unk> million dollars when it was frozen freezing.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us are the victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going from bad in the worse.
In the future, most of the crimes online <unk>
The second group of <unk> in importance today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate the protests, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them to motivate you.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a prominent role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do for money, the <unk> as Anonymous as Anonymous who do to protest and the last group are the United States of the national and governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of the government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of board board the Netherlands or indeed it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
They put the safety of the site and give a <unk>
Last week, I asked, in a meeting with representatives of Dutch government, asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> the death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how does people die from a heart of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do you call <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, services like <unk>
Except <unk> a foreign foreign authority.
And that was going to be inspired by <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters based on April American police headquarters in April 2011, and during the building, they found a lot of papers.
And I was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had been sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communication of citizens in the country.
They had been sold by this tool by 280 euros the government <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to protect them to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, only a couple of weeks ago we found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's going to be beyond.
The connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why would you <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that you live today, will be forever.
So let's eat blindly in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the south of National Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the cows and the National Park in Nairobi.
Mayor of Nairobi in Nairobi has no fences in the top of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it very bad because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up very much to lions.
They were dying of the people who protect our community and the livestock, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think there are so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that I happen to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions was scary.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because I even helped the lions to see the wooden <unk>
I don't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions to believed that he was close to the <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were left, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions came out.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that it moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that turn to turn off the lights.
And this is a little lamp on a <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell picks the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity into the little <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how they see lions when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> lions to think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to have a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses, you heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals that lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You see the <unk> you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've set up in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea also used to be used by all Kenya, so it would frightening other predators like muscular <unk> and it's also using it to little elephants of farms.
Thanks to this invention, I had the fortune to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping raise funds and <unk>
It even led my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I show you how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in meadows from the savanna, <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes they could be inside of you.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to get to be an engineer from aviation and pilot when I grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture what exciting is to listen to a story like you.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other <unk>
What is the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electric CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented electric fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: So I read it once, one time, right? And I tried to do it before, but I got a couple of because I got a <unk>  CA: <unk> <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We are going to <unk> them in every single step that <unk> friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we will move all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea are the enemies.
But sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until all changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public performance.
But I thought my life in Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my colleague of my sister.
What I said, "When we <unk> this -- the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks before.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
I was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At a little while, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a little boy in his arms looking at his face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine drew North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They were also made more and more <unk> the energy <unk> all around us was completely dark at night except for the lights in the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives relatives.
But I just thought I'd be a separate of my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee refugee <unk>
But I suddenly learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also, because the North Koreans refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was terrified in the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to wrap up.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer said to each other, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are seeking <unk> <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although the <unk> were eventually released after a lasts international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't get so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
But I was fortunate to leave, many other North Koreans haven't had so lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all the world can be done in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to take South Korea to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of <unk> years of <unk>
I even went through an identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call my pride in pride of mine.
Although we were going to go to the life in South Korea it was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam research exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a lot of money that sent my family, and as I blame my family was going to be shifted to the force to a place far away in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took one flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to engage in a way, for over 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost trapped several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and <unk> by a Chinese police officer.
He asked all of you -- and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, and I was standing up and said they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribing the <unk> guards, <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was busted and incarcerated for crossing the border.
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything by releasing my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was coming up with the office of immigration and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man asked, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would ask to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM <unk> and gave me the rest of the money to my family and for another two North Koreans and get them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I asked her, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown <unk> is a new hope for me and for the village to <unk> when they were more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of unknown and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk>
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or any money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of the English language practices and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us are still in contact with family family, and we send information and money that are helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans for an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans around the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South Center.
This is <unk> <unk> shops of <unk> fast food, <unk>
So the city planners got together, and you thought, we're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else -- so they changed to Los Angeles to South L.A., as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --  <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk>
Like millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center, home of food to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I think that happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel like they had access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of the house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> chairs and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of taking 45 minutes from back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land that we call a <unk>
It's about 45 me x three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what I get in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This was how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> we sit and start planting our food forest -- <unk> trees, you know, nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of paid group by addressing all of the <unk> from all the city and completely voluntary and everything that we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then someone gets <unk>
The city came up with me and in summary, I was given a <unk> saying that I had to take my yard, and the <unk> was done <unk>
And I said, "Go on, right?
A criminal command by planting food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, you know, <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had a story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It's about 68 miles of <unk>
That's 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> millions of <unk> plants.
Why on Earth doesn't look like this?
You have a plant to give a thousand, 10 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for the South Center.
I grew up there. I grew up there.
I was reminded to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I'm growing my art.
Such a <unk> artist <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the ground, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, they're my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the earth can do, if you let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I'm a witness to how my garden became a <unk> tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They are <unk> to see how it affects guys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion that came up with a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> in the night and they were in my garden, I went out and looked very <unk>
Now, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame by seeing people who were so close to me hungry, and this just reinforces the reason why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people will steal your <unk>
So what I say, "My God is no fear that you're going to be <unk>
It's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to get it, but at his time, I want you to get his <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared his stories about how this had affected and how they used to plant their mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed this is just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to planting maybe 20 garden.
We've had 50 people who come from, work and <unk> every single volunteer plan.
If the kids are growing <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If you raise tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is being told if you don't show them how food does affect the mind and the body, eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're supposed to do, but you have this thing that are stuck with color kids that are on this path designed for them, that doesn't take them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these guys to train these communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I don't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because free is not sustainable.
What's interesting about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to put people in the street to get the streets on the street, who know the joy, the pride and pride and honor to grow their own food, opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take their <unk> right?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call me sitting in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very nice road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains, a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you go on on your bike and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, would like a <unk>
The solution for that is to make real-time <unk>
The asphalt asphalt is a material that we use right now in most of the highways of the Netherlands, and it has pores and water can go through it, so all of the rain water flow down into the sides and you will have a road for which it's easy to drive, and it doesn't make water <unk>
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all of the noise disappear, so it's a very silent <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> See that in this road the stones on the surface of the surface <unk>
Just a stone -- then you get a lot more and more and more and more, and so on, well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can damage your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can really see how damage appears in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so there's only a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> the <unk> -- this <unk> the glue between the <unk> are <unk> and if you're going to be <unk> you're going to be <unk> and <unk>
So, if you drive the road, you get the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials from <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wool from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel <unk> into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat heat -- especially steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is heat steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
Today I use an <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the exhibition, which I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried many samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we set up a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway highway, where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We did aging for samples, we put them a lot of burden on them, and then you get them with our <unk> machine, and the ears go back to a try.
We can repeat this so many times.
Well, to conclude, I can actually say that we have made a material using fibers from steel bringing these fibers using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even able to double the life of the surface of the road, they can actually save a lot of money from very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have a curiosity.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how it acts the same.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to her little gray radio radio.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> she was afraid my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now I can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years ago when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was inspired as a child to <unk> my older sister who was no longer alone to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could get them together.
Every day, we were a different route so that nobody could be suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in stock bags for it that we go shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a little room.
It was pleasant in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew we knew our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in a week, the school closed suddenly for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters had a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> in the remote province of Afghanistan. They found that their daughter, my mother, went to school, and that's why his father was broken.
But my mother educated was teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, even though the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not educate their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments where I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I was always <unk>
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you help me leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we shall.
So, you still want to do not <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than high school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself a proud to graduate school in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He's not only <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it through the streets of Kabul.
My family thinks of me.
I sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> by them, despite them, even though they were even in front of a opposition <unk>
As a <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went out of the road from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> of being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your home, they are the phone, a voice would tell him that if he was following his daughter to school, I would get it to try.
<unk> now, if he said, "but I won't hurt the future of my daughter for his old and <unk>
What I've realized, in Afghanistan, and this is something that is often forgotten in the West, it is that behind most of whom <unk> there is a parent who recognized the value of his daughter and it sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key to our success.
In fact, they often are the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school, remember, was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
They would argue that these changes didn't last a lot, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and his parents who were going to go through them, I see the <unk> I see a <unk> future and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> I would get it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back. A revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since we broke the <unk> revolution inspired by the surge of massive <unk> as much as the <unk> revolution in the <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the regime <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men were <unk> they were in the edge, <unk> each of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a <unk> bravery to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> Eastern <unk> to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of a brutal war and a loss of about 50,000 dead losses, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the Tunisian regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure of the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted to ask many other women, to rebuild civil society -- <unk> a inclusive transition and just to <unk> democracy and national reconciliation.
It was in about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 to <unk>
After a period of <unk> of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I began to organize workshops on the development of capabilities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women and we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, <unk> leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the Afghan autonomy of the woman and for our right to participation in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> that are <unk> of law policies and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was unanimously and successful.
Women won a <unk> of National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, <unk> the elation of the choice and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the American ambassador and the attack by <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military.
And every day, every day, we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights rapes and their lack of respect to the law.
Our society, made up of a messianic mindset, and it gets more away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and vengeance became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today to <unk> with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Now I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we are choosing evil, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
<unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society continues to <unk> and dominated by law policies and <unk> both for men like <unk>
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than what I needed the election that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the collective representation of the feminine -- the more female representation of it.
We need to stop acting as an expert agents and call days of anger.
We need to start acting like compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, which is not only <unk> but I can also put in practice <unk> <unk> and collaboration instead of competence, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by war, desperately needs to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and the <unk> between the female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way, before you make it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "Is the word of the God of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> which spans the whole of the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the towns have <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- all of the existence.
So this is what it tells us, "My mercy is spreading all the things."
This is what you say, "My <unk> mercy on my <unk>
That will all be <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a fantastic question that has an equally <unk> response.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that everybody else is doing, why she's left?
Why would anyone stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, an expert on domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old, I was just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, I believed my soul <unk> I was attached to the head with a <unk> loaded with <unk>
The man, I loved more than nobody in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap. <unk> <unk> where millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> of <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been about 20 years old, married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, every races, all of the income and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence is going on women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse is only in romantic relationships, <unk> and <unk> or, in a very long duration of the families, the last place we would want or expect to find <unk> which is why, domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to be with a man who was going to read it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women of 16 and 24 years old are three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands were killed in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, <unk> night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and he worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what was most impressed by that first encounter was ready and fun, and it seemed like a countryside.
He had a lot of big <unk> to apples, and a hair <unk> <unk> and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he did from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partners.
He did it all over the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me, who was ready, that I had gone to Harvard, I was a passion to help teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had done it.
And it was why that degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I'd like to do for your partner, so I was able to quit my job and <unk> and I went back to us.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was coming from head in a physical, financial <unk> and psychological psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to bring the threat to violence to see how it reacts to.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where he was supposed to be <unk> had to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept underneath the pillow on our bed and third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma, who lived with a little bit smaller.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and even though I never had my hands, my life was already serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, put my <unk> suit of my mother and married him.
Despite what had occurred, was confident that we were living happy forever, because I loved him and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was just very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never get any harm.
I spent two times more on our moon.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and I was <unk> and he gave me so strong in my head that <unk> a lot of times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey and <unk> by the traffic and threw a Big Mac Mac <unk>
<unk> followed <unk> once a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only in this situation.
One of three American women is the victim of domestic violence or bullying at some time in their life, and the Center for Disease Control informs that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: why do I get <unk>
The answer is straightforward.
I didn't know he was picking up from me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to deal with their <unk>
The other question everybody else does is, why don't you just be <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the most sad and agonizing question that people do, because we were the victims, we know something that you normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence are happening after the victim was in order to <unk> after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions they include permanent decisions, even after the <unk> have gone back to marriage, <unk> from financial resources, and their family judicial system and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's just not being gone.
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke silence.
I told everyone around the world: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, all of strangers, and I am here today because all of you were <unk>
We have the trend to <unk> victims as well as <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
Some people are a way to say, "The fault is yours for <unk> as if the victims <unk> victims of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also were also <unk> that they learned that they learned a foreign lesson from what happened and to address their lives joyful lives and happy as <unk> wives and <unk> lives of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor.
I became marrying a cute man and <unk> and we have those three children.
I have this white <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to get back to you more, would ever be a gun that was charged with my head in the hands of someone who says he wants me.
So at this moment, you are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> which is a <unk> or <unk> which I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people, and I assure you there are a few people, who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or that they were <unk> themselves.
The abuse could be affecting their daughter, your sister, to their best friend right now.
I was able to end up to my crazy love love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Sex abuse are only in silence.
They have the power of local violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their <unk> their friends and family.
They had their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims of a safe side.
Together, we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call this Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have dressed like this.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they were <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but figure out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
They are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part of it is going through this sweater by the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why did this happen?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've completely changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally awkward and a photographer said to me that I was going to get the back and I would tell the hair of the kid.
Of course, with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I did two days ago for work, there are very little days to make our look, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my labor sector, that's going to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people are always doing, but they are <unk>
The first question is, how does it be a role model?
I always say, <unk> <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made it model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not just defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've known to use to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that now shows <unk> and maybe some lovers are <unk> to be <unk>
First of all, you know, <unk> by knowing about models.
But sadly, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York I told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- that is less than four percent, not white were white people.
The next question that people always ask me, can be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know about that.
But then, what I would really tell you to each of these girls is, why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you're the first.
If after this list, I was still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> American magazine or the next executive director of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that if you were to be a model is like saying that you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate to you all about what I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you take your studies, and you have a copy and a few jobs to your back, no matter what you want, I mean, if you want to be president of the United States, but you have a <unk> <unk> <unk> for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yeah, virtually all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was told, and also the first time I was using a <unk> and I didn't even have my period yet.
I know we're entering the personal domain, but it was a child.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here's a <unk> party a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team, and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, let's get things for free?
I have too many <unk> <unk> and I never use, except the couple before, but the privilege that I get is the ones I get in real life, and the ones that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to bring the money, and they gave me for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and of course <unk> and <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> from these privilege by my way, not because I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year -- teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of me, <unk>
But how many times do I get older, and I <unk>
When I research to this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure rises to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is, how is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little <unk> and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and I love.
And behind the cameras, we give a response that maybe the <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, ingenious people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we're never saying in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I am because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most primitive legs -- the brightest hair and clothes -- but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to hold out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was much enough enough to hold up a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go to the <unk>
There was no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, and even a little bit very carefully in lighting light.
In fact, most of them took random tourists randomly.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
And he happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why not take you to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that were going to get us to get the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, nobody has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much of the life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This is a picture of a few weeks after <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a lot more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way of stopping time in a week of October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always took the same photo, our perspective on new <unk> -- my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something we hope with illusion all the year.
So recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, it was stopped in a dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the gift store that <unk> in small visits in front of the <unk>
And he described to me what was about five years old in that same place.
He remembered their heart <unk> with strength by seeing that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who gets the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you didn't get to come up with someone and ask him, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most popular birds group.
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter as well as <unk> <unk>
More recently, if they've been following the press and laughter, laughter and <unk> these are the attributes that relate to the Parliament. But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not clean up the environment.  <unk> are not helping to prevent disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And so my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> in the New World of New World in the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank, where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> are important? First of all, they provide life ecological services <unk>
They're our <unk> natural garbage <unk>
They had the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria -- they help absorb the best, which is not to be <unk> and causing huge losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous importance.
They've been associated with the ancient culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and childcare, and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and Under Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian devil?
In <unk> culture, they are very important <unk> in places like Tibet, -- there's no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, on the critical list of extinction, what means that in less than 10 or 15 years -- and the reason is because they fall prey on the consumer consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> <unk>
This drug has been banned by veterinarian in India and they've taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there have been a spread of the number of dogs in <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge bomb bomb over to <unk> The number of cases of anger has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we need to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds.
These are birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible <unk> trade trade to serve the <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they're going.
We can see that travel through different countries, so I'm going to focus on a living problem, it's not going to serve at all.
We need to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that we have.
How can you help? It can make <unk> make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When out of this room, they will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that it changed from opinion because he saw them without effort, without the energy in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do was <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> young people, but I am not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> of <unk> <unk> and Somalia. In projects of African countries.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in Sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all you would have <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we got <unk> seeds in the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent Valley of Zambia to the river River, and we teach the local to grow tomatoes Italians and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they were not going to be able to come to work, and we were hoping that the local in such fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't know anything, simply we said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> time to save the people from Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato number, and Zambia.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> came up from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk> "You're never <unk>
I thought that we were only the Italians who were doing mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, they did, what they were doing and after seeing what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk> --  -- <unk> see the waste that gave them to <unk> people from Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture of a different culture like my kids, "I want a lot of my kids.
<unk> I try all of a different culture of a different culture like my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This is supposed to be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference was put a cane on the floor and said, <unk> you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided at 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you can never initiate anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you do? You get <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We met in a pub.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for a time instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, for a time, but not in <unk> meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what you want to do with their own money, what do they have <unk>
So planning has this point to the blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't belong to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family medical doctor for the company, the family medical doctor who sets up with you at your house at the kitchen table, and that helps him find the resources to transform their passion in a form of living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this path garbage that we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on it, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, died at '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business spirit.
So now we will have <unk> reconstructing the <unk> without knowing what the most important people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you, your privacy has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you talk about, you know, more of this morning <unk>
Local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil revolution -- fossils and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a wonderful story that was in a magazine magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year 2000, we met this group of people, and they were <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City in a hundred years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that would be <unk> New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States came up with <unk> manufacturing companies, <unk>
And the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few years old, <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan.
There's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer <unk>
In another way, they won't come to talk with you.
Then you have to offer any absolute, dedicated <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the larger company, has to be able to do three things that are <unk> the product you want to sell to be fantastic, you have to tell a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can be able to do, to sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 companies from the Carnegie <unk> <unk> Ford, all new companies, Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: No one was started by one person.
I don't hear the word myself, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
No one begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a little bit of small business and small business environment in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for you, what someone did for you, what someone who's talking about this guy, someone who tells you, what do you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't buy a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and order more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understanding our <unk>
How do you share more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect on our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant wild and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and I trust a city.
It always gives the music --  there's a <unk> in New York City --  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture of the world, but also one with the largest military properties.
I live near this house, and I thought how could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood, and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and <unk>
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this produced a profound gratitude for time and so on.
He gave it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But they were trying to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to be catching up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this giant house on a giant <unk> and he painted on it phrases to <unk> she stopped <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspiration in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before they died, I want to be <unk> by <unk>  "Before I die I want to sit at <unk> on the line of <unk>
"Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before they die I want to plant a <unk>
"Before they die I want to live outside of the <unk>
"Before I died, I want to help you again again."
"Before they die I want to go to the rescue <unk>
"Before they die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space has become <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and new ways -- it's about giving up the reflection and <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in her community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit. And now they've made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions -- it's getting more important than ever, to find the ways to keep the perspective and remember that life is <unk>
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even to think, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that we have more power.
And if you think about death -- we have our life.
Our spaces shared the better what we care about as individuals and as community and more media to share hope, the people and stories, people around us cannot help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
Don't speak, but transmits joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> pass what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
I don't care about religious differences and notice in this: It's never <unk>
When singing from our childhood, trying to say the words that I couldn't even tell me -- it reminds me of one thing: the little thing we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel has 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> memory <unk>
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I was getting pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk> birthday.
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people disagree with it.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case -- even though they didn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which were <unk> autistic and extraordinary people.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In every single individual it manifests in a different way, from there that will be so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, we are diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development of development that faster in the world, there is no cause or no cure cure,
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When I was a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking straight off the washing machine and eat anything that would have <unk>
As I was growing up, it would become more different, and the differences became more apparent.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments when I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change for the normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could give it one thing to <unk> and to Sam and to you, it would be a normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift in their interior and honestly, the pursuit of normal, is the ultimate sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> the progress and change is dying at the time when we try to be like others.
Please. I don't say I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> at the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher to give a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.   <unk> real <unk> of these students with their big minds and his big books and their big unknown ones.
But when those conversations, I felt what they had had to have felt like when he fell down the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt like I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key thing to open that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenge from energy to the environment and health care among others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not in fact, and I think it's our responsibility as scientists don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are invited to see the wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that you study the <unk> but study <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making them stupid as they do.
Instead, as Einstein said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate your science without compromise the ideas.
So one thing to consider is to use examples, stories, and analogies are ways to connect and <unk> with their content.
And when I present your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
They've been wondering why they call <unk>  What do you do? The bullets are killed and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it supports too much in the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase -- <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit of a little bit, and then they provide a graphics that will lead to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it is about.
I think these are just some key ones that can help us open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of the Oxford Oxford is <unk>
Just because it sounds good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor in the 19th century that defined it a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you look for a public charge no matter whether or <unk> and that, when I won, it gets the mere use of a monumental monumental monumental use.
I have no idea what it means.
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all the politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, who British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the freaky name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
They got on the Tower Tower and he said, but he had enough enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and policy interact, I want you to go back back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call a leader of a <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
There were all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> of the <unk> state and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> -- George <unk> and other <unk> from the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was very <unk>
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed run.
And there could be <unk>
All the world got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the daily paper a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call her King if he was giving him or his <unk>
So they wanted to give it the most <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> they had happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. Not invented the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents had been <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but it was really a somewhat meaningless.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take a serious title with a <unk> and insignificant title as the President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as a <unk> degree.
President Barack Obama was lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says it is that when a government says it is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep waiting for us to get a few more <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important thing, and this is the title of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more of 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy in the world and a fleet of aerial air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has laced the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern in the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness by then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the end, the Senate won and the House of <unk> because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I would like to do is that I want to <unk>
And politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control the reality, but really, really changes much more the words than they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to <unk> in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is warm and heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but mostly of all, that cacophony of male <unk> and stones and stones with primitive.
Like others, I carry a cheap flashlight of light, attached to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in that subway hole that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
And my hand was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met the control and dropped six feet in that well.
While I talk to you today, these men are at the deep age of that hole, their lives without pay, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all of the amazing people I met there met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery in modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was the world in the world, not to such a degree.
When we end up talking to me, I was very sad, I was able to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I got choked up the stomach and a few weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A few of all, I considered it my second home.
But this time -- <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there is more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of Africans displaced during the entire slave slave
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a few dollars of <unk> today.
However, you can have enslaving entire families for generations per capita <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates revenues over <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of you have been <unk> with false promise for good education and better work to then find that they are forced to work without paying for violence in threat and cannot escape.
The slavery operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those of these are <unk>
The slavery exists in almost everybody and yet it is illegal in the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or <unk> <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, whole families -- whole families -- <unk> mechanically brick in their heads, up to 18 to the time, and they take them from <unk> furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, and to drink, and the severe <unk> I made that pee was quite <unk>
And so <unk> they were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to the rest and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the equipment and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> you don't know it. Don't do it here."
And it explained to me so clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this one, not only for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not citizenship in that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for his release and she trusted that he would do it.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children <unk> stones for miles by <unk> by <unk> to trucks they were waiting at the bottom.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who were carrying and children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made from clubs, strings and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves and work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing with what to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness advised me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was inspired by women who had been previously previously <unk>
It led me to a few stairs <unk> which gave this <unk> <unk> light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it's known in craft, they are local prostitution for <unk> prostitution in the world.
They have small rooms -- private rooms where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of only seven years -- are forced to entertain the clients and to <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of it is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted painted on the wall and divided through a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it must be caught in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs so that he <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no big enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because you touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery even sex and sex and all around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a sex slaves.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that often relate to the labor labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were whole families in the trade of the silk.
This is a portrait of family.
The black hands of black are the father, the blue blue and red <unk> of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My <unk> told me his stories.
"We have no <unk> <unk>
You still hope, yet we can go out of this house one day and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more of 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to take a quick look fast.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family in a boat, two older brothers, some young children made sense.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to come up with me was <unk> that his little canoe <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
The branches of the trees are immersed in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and with fear, they spread into the water to release the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of their love, it's not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is to the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five in the morning when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working on the last one.
<unk> and <unk>
And I can actually point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> partners the <unk> a fellow <unk> with her suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
We were asked to take it through a dirt road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were invited to go out of the car, and asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then he pointed up this path barely and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we began to go down, we removed the <unk> that I would go on the way and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team of photos on my head as they put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football camp and they were all full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children strapped their backs, and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These <unk> are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> since many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 90 feet and these people carry up heavy stone bags that then will be shipped up to another area where they get the stone to extract the gold.
And the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the margin to the margin we see to work at other <unk> and also children.
They are all victims of disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
By dying their uncle, <unk> his uncle is the debt of the uncle that force it to be a slave in mines.
When I met her, I worked in 14 years and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so severe that doctors said that I should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream of being liberated and educated with help local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this is this kind of determination, from face to a remote, which inspires me a lot respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted to know that we will be testimony to them and we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I didn't think if we can look at each other as human beings, then it makes it very hard to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I happen to think about these many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to know.
And I hope that these images bring a force in whom you can see, in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn on a fire and that fire will light up light on slavery because without that light, the <unk> beast can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical math -- and there's a particular problem for whom <unk> are like management <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try and tell you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
And we were <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dance dance --  that we'll see more forward.
But <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably some <unk> <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his day, was a virtuous band of mine.
In the last few years, it's been done very much in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way that we're going to know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no <unk> so they don't serve the blood analysis, and the best we have is a neurological test for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic and do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic -- what if patients could be able to ask ourselves?
It would not need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is that what I want to do, as a kind of conventional form for a try, you see, in a sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the <unk> strings here.
It shows someone healthy while it emitted to the sounds of speak, and we can imagine as a dance of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that are needed for example.
And as they <unk> it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Think about time that takes a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as <unk> and as Parkinson's disease, it affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
In the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of strings <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They are both <unk> OK, but also <unk> exams aren't <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly for 30 seconds as a lot.
It's the minimum cost and we all know what happens as well.
When something takes a lot of <unk> it appears on a massive scale.
These are some amazing lists of <unk>
We can reduce the safety of patients.
You wouldn't need to go to the clinic for lunch for routine.
<unk> <unk> we could get goals out.
We could make a <unk> massive <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it is too late.
So by giving you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's disease.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with Parkinson's disease, you can call it at low price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached 6 percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's take all these samples out of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What would you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. TR: TR: Yeah.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> you may not be able to do it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in search of real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have an precision <unk> at this moment?
A lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works in the mobile phone network, as well as the project. Now we have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's <unk>
<unk> of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March March from 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We are <unk> in the dark, in the room without windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We do at thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin -- we do it as possible and we can focus on the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, as the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
And a little time later, an organization where I was an organization that was an organization that was <unk> there, <unk> <unk> was in the place of working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishermen of fishermen who are located in the <unk> of the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by wave.
The level of water recorded over 24 meters tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
<unk> rubble from canals and <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the slime down, and we took the ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We removed tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> from the local factory factory.
We were <unk> and they loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and chambers and cards.
They all did the same thing.
They were able to bring them to different places of the villages around <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they fleeing the wave, and to save her lives, they had to leave everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of the village <unk>
It helped clean the toilets, the huge, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
I had the honor and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going to go through my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some that had more than a hundred years ago, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think of how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked on Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive -- that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl was supposed to have a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would have no aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they arrived for kind of more photos and they had more <unk> and it got more <unk> so I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries was offered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were invited to <unk> a village to the north of <unk>
Once we use our scanner in the libraries of the temporal libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
So the time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, <unk> of course the <unk> of the photos.
It could make an hour. I could make a couple of weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw a lot of hand by hand using the areas whose color and detail there was no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures left in saltwater, covered with bacteria, even with oil, and even with oil, all of it along with the time I still continue to go on with the time to hand it was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford it to be clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with the <unk>
We have the guide for a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the photos anymore.
As he said, once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
I had begun to <unk> it itself but stopped by realizing that the <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been, we were able to collect the images in a single picture and put it off the whole picture.
When I picked up his photos shared some of her story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble station was very far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave of glass.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their small children, not as small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took him a week to find his whole family and knew that they were all survived.
The day I gave him his photos his youngest son, <unk>
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could remember from the past that he could remember from the past day of March when everything in his life changed or it was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, <unk> hundreds of them were helped to clean up more of <unk> photographs -- great <unk> -- the great majority came back to their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to bring up 90 million photos and fully <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 in teams and materials and materials, most of the ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One picture is a picture of someone or something, one thing, one relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take but the first thing that we need to look for.
This is what the project was about to restore little pieces of humanity, to bring someone to someone with the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that the <unk>
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger to bring something, using their talent for something that are not a thin skin models for perfect skin.
To finish the email I'd like to read this email -- I emailed Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one in particular, a picture with women of different ages from grandmother to the little girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> around a baby, but a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, my mother and my newborn daughter took out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are the themselves, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple exposure to just a millionth of just a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not about a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion from the light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the interior of the body without using X-ray and <unk> really the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer. And I switch it into it and you get it into a <unk> of a second or it is, in several <unk> to create a photo package of just a millimeter millimeter long.
And that package of photons that <unk> travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a bullet bullet in a common.
If we take that bullet that a bullet and the photons package and <unk> in this bottle, how they disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in the <unk>
Now, all of this --   -- that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research   <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a pack of photons that starts <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons eventually get the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces on the inside.
In that time, the waves travel through the table and because of the insights of the top of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a bullet and current and we make it go down the same distance and we see it in slow it down at about 10 billion times, how much you think that it would take us to sit at this film?
One day?
It would be a very boring film --  of a bullet slow on motion.
And how about to test with nature <unk>
You can see the waves coming out of the table, the tomato <unk>
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at the time -- but of course, our eyes see a wide tail.
But if you look at more and more look more like this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light is <unk> from tomato <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces on its interior and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera in India?
As a photographers, you know, if we took a picture to low exposure, it goes into very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the first short exhibition that you can just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons -- millions of times, and we recorded over and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> of data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those raw data and make it really interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can get invisible, any heroes can get invisible, they can become invisible, they can get invisible.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door and you get it into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And we could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We've built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons went back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It's very good resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door, and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it corresponds to a distance.
When a laser can you record a picture of a second, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are going to be <unk> with what's going around the curve, which is going to turn around.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build <unk> that can be able to see the interior of the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of tissue and blood -- this is quite hard, so this is actually an order to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new framework for visualization to solve the problems of <unk> for the next generation.
So as a <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, I became the science of art, an art of photographs of photographs of photography.
I realized that all the <unk> data that we collect each time are not just for scientific visualization, but we can get to.
And to create a new form of computer photography with a slow camera and <unk>
And look at those waves -- remember, the time between each one of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's a lot of fun here.
If you look at the waves underneath the <unk> you're going to go away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
And it turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order of the events that happen in the world sometimes <unk> <unk> in the camera.
And then we have the corresponding warps of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile cell can <unk> your life, and gives you free freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, put it to <unk> and become famous.
This is all possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people <unk> in search of a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who are there a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones.
<unk> A <unk> an Blackberry, wow!
It's pretty much all of you today have a mobile phone.
But today I'm talking about my phone, and how it changed my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 kilometers of information.
raw data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission filed a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European phone company, every service provider of all Europe, has to store a wide range of information information.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends him a text for <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or their Internet <unk>
And all of Europe were stood and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone and the providers of the Internet <unk> all this information on us.
There were lawyers, journalists, we all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also asked if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use your <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which for please give me all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask me, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk> <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
And so I decided to take a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we will give you this information.
At the end of it, you know.
<unk> the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Khmer Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> <unk> 30 lines of information.
When I first saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file -- OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little <unk> what had to do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk> retention means.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open came City, we did this.
This is a visualization visualization of my life.
You can zoom out and switch back and go forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call it the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
But of all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she called, talk a couple of time.
Then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then one called the other one, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communications network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other, what time you call one another, what time you sleep.
You can see all this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what's doing the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who send you an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were -- this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and businesses want to store as much information from us as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the chance to follow our lives and want to be <unk>
But <unk> and living in the digital was not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you turn home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century and that is not quite fashion.
When you go home to go home, send them to your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your company, and what do you store of you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remind you that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why we <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, although they are.
It only happens by accidents, like the one I came up at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not an inspirational source, and I don't want any of you in the present line.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you've used to be disabled.
Go walk.
<unk> in Christmas, you're in the shopping center, and they drive into circles and what do you see?
16 places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
And also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim Muslim and I live and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might be able to do it.
I'm in Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
And the mantra of my father was, "Can you ask yourself, do you do it, do it -- do you get <unk>
If my three older sisters were <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents went to the school system, my parents went to the school system, and they were <unk> that I also are, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note every year, the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me about walking five years to put my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another tactical thing that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to get it.
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a <unk> champion that has gotten a lot of taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
There are now 20 Arab and continue to be all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a <unk>
The people that grew up had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> that died of hunger during the <unk>
I would say I had enough fat to live three months to live three months without eating, so I stopped at dawn at dusk -- it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I sent me to the dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whether I can walk in <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were worried that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get into <unk>
In the summer vacation I often was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> so I was drinking <unk> milk on the back of the back, and I was stuck in the <unk> Sea and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I make yoga was a comedian of <unk> who could not stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents would ask this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a scholarship for the University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater.
All of me was <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my teachers would say.
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slowly, in Jackson.
It's a play of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> "When I finally have a <unk>
I have paralysis
At the end of it -- they finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am finally <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running in the head of the theater, crying in historically, as if someone had murdered my cat, ask her why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't make the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the <unk> you can't do the <unk> either.
It was a paper that was literally born and they gave an actor without the brain <unk>
The college was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors for disabled
When I graduated, I went home, and my first tour, <unk> was an extra thing in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that directors of <unk> <unk> actors -- not white, with disability.
Just give it to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
In my first tour, I took a famous sample from New Jersey to New Jersey, and never forget the face of the first comedian that led to high speed on the New Jersey highway highway with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that they never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they are really fun.
In 2003, my brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival in New York, now in his year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and once remind the directors of <unk> and Arabs are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was as invited to the news TV program, it has Keith <unk>
I walked out as if I went to a graduate dance, I was invited to a study and they sat in a <unk>
I looked at the director and said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clinging to the <unk> desk not coming out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but it was just like the <unk> <unk> and pasted my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The children are said that kids are <unk> but they never had a little girl and no older than me.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became a <unk> object.
<unk> clips on the line, like, "Why do you <unk>
Is it <unk>
And my favorite favorite, <unk> terrorist <unk>
What do you have?
We should really pray for her."
A reviewer suggested even that I would say, my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair cannot do <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there was more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> children from <unk> a charity, to give children Syrian refugees a little bit of what my parents would come from.
It was the only time my father saw me working in live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is close to <unk>
<unk> propels the small people to poverty and the edge of <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there is no opportunity -- there is no work, not in the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
So maybe one year ago, nothing.
One day you get a gentleman who gives him to take it to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes to get home, to send home, your family.
They show a young lady.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a car car.
That child in that small village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So, how the story of a child in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for the future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that he took it out of what we call "the <unk>
And his story is repeating in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young <unk> <unk> riots who were riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of town, the great dream of city is the opportunity of the opportunity, of jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they didn't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> the door of access to terror, the violence, to be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, and if he had never gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a few juvenile leaders on a business level.
<unk> to about 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, because he was a college graduate student, frustrated, frustrated, was the perfect white man for <unk> and other terrorist organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point A B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> <unk> to local residents who were normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expanding hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> in <unk>
They encourage young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who was attending one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the top of corporate initiative and how to create a culture of business initiative to create a culture.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until recently, until recently until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic from the abroad.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
Those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and design company.
I created a farm outside <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started from flowers for wedding and creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the first <unk> public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink roses <unk>
By the way, he's not <unk> pink because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO to work for government, but their story, it really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They provide business solutions for local problems.
So then, inspire young people and create a culture of corporate spirit culture, it's really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to engage in the development of their business.
They encourage the young people with the resources that they need, and we will support the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park <unk> is how it called, when it's created, transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and maintain <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their <unk> innovation and have more stories about flowers and the Parks of the Peace <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains <unk> an area in the north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we could just pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed had a <unk> of about four square feet with the heart of apple <unk> balls and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very mad and incredibly <unk>
<unk> who were too lazy too lazy to get what they thought was going to clean up his <unk>
That question followed with me, and he was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where do you get the <unk> who clean our garbage in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, and by 11,000 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked out of their pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities all the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I need more to go into more <unk>
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel on the trucks. I would <unk>
And we've operated the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong -- you will be <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of emerging <unk> the collection of waste is one of the ten largest <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and pass through around you.
They just want <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a way of breath or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think the <unk> of waste are the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient form of efficient and effective form every day, this begins to <unk> from their container and their dangers inherent in very real ways.
Heart disease we had controlled for decades and centuries they start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for what the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's <unk>
I'm not advocating by capitalism, just to point out its relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average speed velocity as well.
So I mean just at the speed that we used to move in the <unk>
We usually didn't have any <unk> or <unk> we picked up with us our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them -- we forget about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side that will take for it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keeps us safe from ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow will always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a garbage garbage truck on the street, grabbed my little little baby up on the street, and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for making her work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be fine.
Let's be okay."
Little after that, I started to investigate waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together a lot of times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and have in account all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor.
<unk> <unk> what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing you see someone whose job is clean up the trash of you, a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is in the connection to thinking about our communal life to be part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought in two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become a essential part of the ultimate work of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a <unk> mall in the capital of Ethiopia, Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design for.
And at first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because the coating with crystals generates heat in the interior, so we need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it is a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, what it looks like is nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a worth for a rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually <unk> with the old market that is this structure to the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a building building, from several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge is presented to the survey of the site, which is located in a very much growth area in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the picture, there is not there.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries out of the building.
And this is <unk> with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the open air in the building that would spread through its own shape of the sun and the rain and the rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes in every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that <unk> the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric of the concrete shell, with <unk> to allow the air of the air and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dress of the <unk>
They have fractal geometry of fractal geometry and that helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use light from the inside of the building to light the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it was not what we had.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the mall because at the end of accounts there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was so much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings on the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity was short at nearly every day.
So we got a great advantage by putting up <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, that we collect water for the <unk>
It's expected for early next year, because we're going to the fifth floor of building construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to run a project so big, the biggest thing that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city, but also to their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I was especially focusing on <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen doors of access to almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first operation, of design that we did was to expand the streets and create 12 initial initial blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some dots through a relationship with the idea of the doors of <unk> with straight lines, and this changes the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as a part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the weather <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilated,
So let's make a framework that ensures that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local standards that set up greater density on the higher levels and a lower density in the plant floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community occupied by building <unk>
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and make activities such as run a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they are in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes communities and local economies at the same pace that buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between community and the environment, and they have as a target to connect nature to people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see every new girls.
He had great amounts of hair, and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good at <unk>
I ended up with that year and I was full of jealousy, until I was <unk> my plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the <unk> of school, I was a bit later and hid in the <unk> bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher from grades.
And then I did.
<unk> the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a few things.
All the things --  And I signed up the book back to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I gave you all rows of <unk> and myself just a row of a way of being there, because I was <unk>
I'm still surprised by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I was very important.
I don't understand why I would never be surprised.
It was all obvious <unk>
I would never be surprised.
But above all, I was fascinated by the reason that I was bothered by this little little little little little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a <unk>
<unk> the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or long duration or sadness.
So you have to go fiction, because novels are like the lab in which they study <unk> in all possible ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if I had no jealousy, I would have no literature either.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There would be no <unk> king <unk> and <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school -- because we would be missing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> or <unk> we were <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No jealousy, I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as the jealousy, almost all of them has all of them.
This year was done 100 years of their <unk> study for the <unk> study of <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the poor <unk> -- my whole thing that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot about how hard that image.
We forgot about the relentless that it is.
I mean, this is the books that Virginia <unk> were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, that the jealousy, which is reduced to the person, their desire, to their <unk> are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being to <unk> and audience, we know exactly what <unk> details to them, right?
<unk> do all of novelists <unk> and that's something that <unk> understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to each other, maybe now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool shock that <unk> detects in his lover, it adds to his collection of instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> information <unk>
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great amounts of hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links right the language of the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his parenting agony as soon as the door of the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their lover, then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> are <unk> and they make it seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're finding a search for knowledge, finding the truth, really painful -- in fact, to what <unk> <unk> the more painful, the best thing to do.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk> toward the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need -- that makes us relate to us with us a lot of much more profound feelings and vital feelings than a wise man that can be able to give us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal us to ourselves.
And there is some other excitement that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There is some other excitement that we were excited about, our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other emotion that teaches us to look at intensity is so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud went to a very young woman who was being consumed with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud says there was something weird in that man, who was not <unk> in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspected without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing <unk>
<unk> <unk> or did they accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how the <unk> are made us to look at intensity -- but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> the more <unk> we are, we became more <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts or illegal acts.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about my case at eight years, I think -- but I'm also thinking about this story I heard on the news.
One woman of Michigan <unk> was captured by having created a false fake account.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
What massive, even though we make creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who deal with how the jealousy, <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take the most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want to want what you have to take a <unk> to be and <unk> from what you've ever seen, and it's under the floor <unk> your name, it takes your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where a currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about Professor <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius in Professor <unk>
But I've always got <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> face of rat <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in the decline in each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the 6 <unk> once he <unk> <unk> <unk> to all of your solution, <unk> comes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who doesn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. It seems to be this very emotional thing, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
All of a sudden, you can <unk> that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like the plans for <unk>
So as we hope that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction to <unk>
Just <unk> fiction -- jealousy.
<unk> alone invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> <unk> the <unk> Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 of July 1969, Buzz <unk> jumped out of the gold <unk> module and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the dark <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest decline in peace in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA took about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including <unk> <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of the surface of which he ended up after Armstrong died, the past year, is now the most <unk>
So, why would you <unk>
They were not brought a lot of <unk> old pounds of old rocks, and something that was 24 percent later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why did we learn? The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> -- give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why is the <unk>
Why turn it into our target?
And you might also ask, why scale the mountain <unk>
So 35 years ago, why do you fly about <unk>
Why does it play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're difficult. It's hard.
Jason <unk> The <unk> was not just a victory victory on the Cold War.
At the time, the strongest emotion was the <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a very long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
The technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle, but in 1969, the <unk> crew crew flew to 40,000 miles per hour.
Since 1970, no human will become the moon.
No one has been faster than the Apollo <unk> of Apollo 10, and the optimism of optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see that technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy -- cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk> <unk>
And I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't take the <unk> tube from the rocket <unk> Saturn <unk>
I knew somehow that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would come to see colonies on Mars.
So that's what it occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It seems like the technologists had found us and had enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that are speeding up by selling <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've extended and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation that has been done in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have created the less ambitious companies that were <unk> at Intel -- Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists give the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of <unk> ideas to <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly what's wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when your risk capitalists were at their peak and not worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment, a little bit of the ones that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with profit in technologies like energy, which need a massive capital and that development is not in the long term, they have never invested in the development of technologies dedicated to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would take a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things than doing on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems have fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from sources of renewable energy -- the solar and the <unk> -- Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, And economists and economists agree about what political policies and treaties <unk> the development of an <unk> energy development, which is a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see a global energy policy or treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the great problems that seemed technological, are not to be.
We know for time that famines are a result of failure in the route of food.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are the political crisis that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nixon President declared war to cancer in 1971, but we soon found that there are a lot of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have been found effective and viable treatments.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and have a lot of -- but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support <unk> must be really about a <unk> problem, and we must understand it.
<unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, it serves with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no competition in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> the <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They are so common that they've become <unk> in our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a very large decrease of trust, it's a very widespread goal.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that could have increased in others.
I have no sure.
But I can look at opinion polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of belief that the trust has <unk>
When you look at opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite <unk> and nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But that's what enough?
What the opinion opinion polls are, of course, views.
What else can you get?
What you look at are the attitudes <unk> that people play, when they do some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> on the teachers of <unk>
You probably want to ask: "So do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to <unk> the confidence in a <unk> way.
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel by a certain kind of official, the official or a person is going to be uniform in all cases.
I may, for example, saying I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give the class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think studies are very bad tools to measure the real confidence level -- because they're trying to <unk> the good math judgment in something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I tend to have more trust in what is <unk> but not what it is.
In short, I'm <unk> not trust what you're not reliable.
And I think that those people who were doing their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
One time you say, it says, yes, that means that what it matters in first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the raw terms, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, in contrast, they're not responsible for them to trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to bring a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see it <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't been surprised.
But that's what we're going to be <unk> around before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last decades, we have tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions for all sorts of institutions, the professionals, officials and so forth, that they would make us easier to judge their reliability.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that I will attend to be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we <unk> that the accountability system that is meant to ensure the <unk> and the evidence for <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they give the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You probably all know similar examples.
They were doing all that, by the target.
And I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they are worthy of trust and empowering people that are reliable and if you were to determine whether other people or political officials are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions, the <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
You know, <unk> to the task to rebuild the trust, puts things up on the other way.
It suggests that you and I should be <unk>
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, it's <unk> because they give it other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them the cost enough that you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't get <unk> usually to all people, all the time.
But you also have to bring you evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That makes it every day, everywhere, doing the common people, <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my mind says I can <unk> without giving any explanations anymore.
I take them and get it back the money, or they change it by the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're pointing at is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and that framework, you can determine when and how other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early computers of computers, we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen is that the imagination can <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> and more and more, to a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a glass screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everybody.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I began to imagine how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is their physical body to the pixel
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break the barriers.
But the two hands stay out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with the digital information using all the dexterity on the hands?
In the division of Science at Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a computer area.
They put a transparent bombsight with deep cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and <unk> or <unk> or words with the virtual tactile sensor that's below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information come into us?
<unk> many of us would have bought and explore things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about it.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device into the head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make physical care so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical brand.
This imam <unk> acts as a 3D facility in space, which means that the computer is so able to move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And to program the object, the object, we set it out of the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and come back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and <unk> and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike monitors or textbooks or text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday activities.
As you can see, digital data will not only show us something but to start acting directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to <unk> out of our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if I would take that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
And I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to take a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed strongly that there was only an effective path to the <unk> a safe way to <unk>
No matter if the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer Chinese House.
This was me in my imaginary piano.
One opera opera singer has to start from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the news of a radio show.
But no adult read the idea.
No adults took me seriously.
Only my friends, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life is a second of the only thing that could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me just wanted to <unk> OK.
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I did here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda any <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange <unk>
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt trap.
The encounter with a new culture also gave up to my reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me from place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading isn't something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are all the way to research in research like comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked worked for research, why not do it also in the life of <unk>
So I started reading books in two.
They can be from <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  Instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> Chinese means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I used to feel like I used to feel like <unk>
Having a <unk> dream really is nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from, where the passion, where happiness.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk> them.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first <unk> customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student, in psychology at Berkeley.
She was a 26 year-old woman named <unk>
Alex came into the first session using jeans and a <unk> encounter he threw out on the couch in my office and taken off the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I was a <unk> who wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought up to the <unk> it made me easy to move the head while it was <unk> the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> said, Alex, and so I saw she was right.
You start to work after that, they have children later, it has children later, even the death goes on.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time <unk>
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> pushed me to push Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Yes, he's coming out of guys underneath his category, and they were <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe they were <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people sit down after what they did, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex a pause in its development.
This made the Alex <unk> the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and I had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, the families and the future of <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody gets at age without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take off the dream of a <unk> I want to see -- it's fine. <unk> <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be going to be 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and transcendent moments that give her life to your life have happened for the time you have 30 and <unk>
People who are more than '40s, I don't <unk>
This public is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming with their future partner for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up in the second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that the female fertility gets to its top to the 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the time to take care of your body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday and common life has an impact on the person who gets <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> adolescence.
The reporters gave up <unk> names of <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to get great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think that happens when you give you a <unk> in your head and you say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> intelligent, interesting as you or your children get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't matter. I'm not just killing time."
Or they say, "All they say as long as I start a career before the 30, everything will be well."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I was better for the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running up and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned the music and everybody started to sit on.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little extreme, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things to <unk> there's a huge pressure on the age of 30 and so many of them start a career, choose a city, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start to show -- which is much more difficult and <unk> to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle-aged crisis <unk> is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give him a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At the 25, Emma came to my office because I was in his own words, having a identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but he still couldn't be <unk> so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, which showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a few very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often in our <unk> but then they were getting up, and she would say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and he cried for almost the hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the entire morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he sat down looking at the empty space that follows after the words said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I give you <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work to resist and I wouldn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which is actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the 1950s.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every man or female, deserves to know.
First, I told Emma that it was <unk> of that identity crisis and <unk> capital capital.
For capital capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital generates capital capital.
So now it's the moment for that work in the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to try.
I'm not <unk> exploration, <unk> I'm <unk> the exploration that I should not count, which by the way, is not <unk>
It's <unk>
I told Emma that I would explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> that come together with friends with minds are just limited to who you know what you know about, how do you think about, how they think, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who is going to get out almost always comes from its circle again.
Things come from what they call the weak links friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half no not, and the weak links are the way that we would call this group.
The half of the work created never <unk> then, to meet the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job in it.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma soon <unk> his family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit on my head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person who you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook begin to walk to <unk> is not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so intentional in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or killing time with whom you are going to get them to you.
So what happened with <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the fellow of a quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped get a job there.
That offer of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend that he alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man who chose a <unk>
He shook her new career, loves her new family, and I sent my new family, and I sent me a letter to say, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not <unk>
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the airport from Los Angeles, which come somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fits in your trajectory is the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or even 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good TEDTalk can have huge effects in the next few years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my notion of spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I have the privilege of saying to <unk> every day: <unk> -- <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get capital of identity, using their weak bonds -- choose your family.
Don't be able to define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very strong job of <unk> <unk> for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them math from seventh grade in New York City schools.
And as any professor, I applied tests and evidence.
I gave them homework.
When I went back, I would save grades.
What struck me was, <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance did not have credit <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of scenarios and in every study, my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids are going to do as far as possible in the competition.
We studied teachers who are working in really hard neighborhoods -- and what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school of the year and to <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the results of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, asking questions, which of these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to win more money?
In all these different contexts -- it arose a feature as a major success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long term.
<unk> is having a <unk>
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a full-time race.
A few years ago, I began to study determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my input <unk> and then I waited for more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination they had significantly greater determination even when they were <unk> in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of evidence -- even the safety results that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National National <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing that we know the science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development would determination for kids?
What should I do to teach kids a solid <unk> <unk>
How do I keep it for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give me <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals that just don't follow forward with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, commonly determination is not related to or even related to the measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Stanford <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to start to start with everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreign band, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
Over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and fast method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and straightforward.
A Chinese <unk> <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic education.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> understanding of the basic pages or newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it is <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, like if I were shouting <unk> <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe that it's the other way. The fact that it will work.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call a radical eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they make a lot more characters.
One person.
If you walk back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If one person puts your arms, this person is saying <unk> this <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>   <unk> of remember, because a single tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two two together, it becomes very hot.
Three percent together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the bright moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
And one door, put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> got someone at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, have <unk>
So we've already been past 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight of them will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every small effort, they will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as a Chinese for eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the first one, because Japan is in China.
So one sun next to first, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked lines, one on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in <unk> because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, diaspora has become <unk>
A mouth that tells you where it comes out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind remind you that I must stop talking and going down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Oz magician, together.
The film was called his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and lead a magic wand
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raised our children in a kind of a complex animal <unk>
Yet, the Oz magician, was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took back 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> kid who had a girl in his enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician, and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the Oz magician, do today, the magician, say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the armies generated by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing of the Oz magician, is that the most amazing characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I had a son in that point.
Just three years.
I was not invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had <unk>  And so slid in the room and he was impressed like a mom with her <unk> behind, and I didn't think he would understand what was happening, but, <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be value, perseverance and <unk>
He would have the feeling that Luke took one to an army to <unk> the government?
They had this with the <unk> <unk>
How do I win Dorothy his movie?
They do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up to grow up -- OK? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why do you have so much force capital -- the force in the movies for our children, and so little on the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence impact on the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
Now, I know for experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served me to navigate the world of the adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first suit I was hoping that the credits would actually appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to wear a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they guys, they're not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job teaching girls how to defend themselves against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being war war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times is going on appearing on classic and every one of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and your son, or two men who raised a child.
So far as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens by <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not going to be roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book book and in the middle of the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of a friend of film <unk>
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you have to <unk> in the movie, there is more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to get the <unk>
These women are talking to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else about the kid you like it?  Really? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things with each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success -- an idea of consensus from what is a Hollywood Hollywood film.
<unk> isn't the proof of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the movie happens in a <unk> where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go in the numbers.
In 2011, from 100 most popular movies how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a bigger number that this is going to come to you, this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
One in the United States, one in five women says it's sexually sexually sexually in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think the music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do they do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence, and then you get the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to get it to them.
We have tools to our willingness as a <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> goes to <unk> if, at the same time, it activates or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here is mostly the parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is changing changing it.
You've heard about how new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter which was his favorite Star character character from "Star <unk> You know what it was.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress of it.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories where I tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where he saw that their work is to join a team, perhaps a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I was living in Maine and one of the things I liked was to look for fortune cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was invited to <unk>
I started to see forms and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, in Egypt, my little beach in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown to one of almost 1.3 miles of length along with <unk>
And my little bit of sea had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see in a different way.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern delta Delta called <unk>
And instead, it seems to be brown -- but when we use infrared and we're going to use the <unk> using <unk> suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape of building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we use satellite data to find an old city -- old called <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of the old art <unk> architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this enormous <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> kilometers.
Before, the Nile <unk> was right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, and as it changed over time, and it covered all of the city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I will try to find it randomly would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So, we use NASA data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where we <unk> the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly <unk> that looks inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborate with scientists doing <unk> work, you can see it here.
When I say <unk> is like the shots of it shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation we look for the <unk>
Five meters down, under a thick thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location, five meters down, we have a <unk> occupation of many hundreds of years that date out of the Middle Empire, exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found the work of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> what demonstrates that there was a workshop shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, these local Empire are the stones that <unk>
So, we have a dense <unk> of occupation which comes from the world's Roman Empire.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry, which shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still didn't find any <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also do great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Roman Empire was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to it, TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas really started in 1984 B.C. at a missing city not for a long time and found out from the high school.
It certainly puts the <unk> search in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing out in front of the door of <unk> home.
I'd like to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> obese in cars.
They are competing in a <unk> and <unk> race in the front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're going <unk>
They collide with the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying around, wheels that go on the side of the wheels that end up in <unk> places, <unk> the threshold of the door.
So in the lobby, or what's on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light -- the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speaks here.
You can feel your blue <unk> by making them tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> cookie.
<unk> on one side and trained his living room.
It's already in the room, and making most of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little baby clothes, dancing on their <unk> singing <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The land has been coated with a yellow brick road and from the oven.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist <unk> waiting, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of different ages and different levels of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- looking at them just once.
They have the names of the dozens and tens of strangers.
We had entire poems in just minutes.
And so I was able to see who I could memorize the highest <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be true of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best memories <unk>
And I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous memory acts using old old techniques -- invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their speakers, and the <unk> academics used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competence, and <unk> who is a wonderful English and brilliant English one, although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
Do you meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why is that?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards live, on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start with something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year, not only training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why doesn't it work and what it can be their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that he didn't even remembered that I had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window to see how much our memory point is makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> In he was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And to come back, a lot of treaties on memory was about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having <unk> disciplined and <unk> it wasn't one thing as rare as it might be like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but we also have changed.
They have been changed <unk> and I would say that they have also changed the cognitive world.
As we almost don't have to remember, sometimes it seems that we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet in where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined <unk> is this competition as unique of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> and <unk>
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College College invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know, to be that it has brains in some way, the structural way or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery and the answer was actually no.
There was a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with that <unk>
When they put them into a MRI machine, <unk> your brains while they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow <unk> they found that in the memory champions <unk> parts of the brain, different than others.
They were actually <unk> or seemed to be <unk> a part of the brain that involves space and navigation.
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
The tournament of competitive <unk> <unk> are driving as a race fund where each year, someone has a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors should be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there's a huge amount of ways to remember things in these <unk> -- absolutely all the techniques used to be reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox as the paradox -- <unk> <unk> says the following: I tell two people who remember the same word, I'm saying to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, you know, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask you to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> what would you do?
The person who was told that his name is <unk> it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. There's no relationship to you.
With all the other memories I dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk> in their hands.
They do well when they come back home to work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting up <unk> <unk> for <unk> at some point back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this back two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, you never brought to a <unk> he would go to a <unk>
He stood up with his memory poem, and he <unk> and so soon it was the room of <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed them to everyone, but it shattered the bodies to <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
I was standing in the middle of the rubble, I closed the eyes and I realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single time.
And I took the family of the <unk> hand where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What you have to pick up at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or numbers of phone or instructions or instructions or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional space numbers.
If you let me tell you the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very likely to do it.
But I would bet that if you told them who was sitting on the horse speaker in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- it's the <unk>
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> of memory in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from the same way that it would have done it, if they had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And he came up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image, crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that this completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine getting into your home, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> over <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they run in the kitchen, and the room that they would talk would be that strange journey that did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help it.
This is like <unk> speakers, <unk> their speakers, no word for word, which is going to confuse it -- it's typical for typical.
In fact, the <unk> <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and on the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first would be like the first place in their palazzo of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got away from full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of <unk> competitive.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an event called a <unk> event.
But seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting in <unk> I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets to <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school officer bought in a market market.
And I discovered that this was fun.
You would never have expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What this is actually about doing is better and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of your mind.
I was really hooked up with this.
This is me using my standard standard training team.
It's a couple of <unk> and a couple of security glasses with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory competitor of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that had been covered a year before. I had the idea that I could be able to make it in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to memorize narratives and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are such a <unk> tricks.
Because they are based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And it's not necessary to be able to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palazzo of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, it's not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It makes a kind of deep, deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of you are not <unk> by there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, this is what <unk> the <unk> who couldn't even remember I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks into our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even care about to process <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are very amazing memory skills in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you need to be the kind of person you remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we <unk> only a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my dorm room, I was the bathroom to share with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time looking at the television and so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everyone was going to see me, and every time I got married, and I would go back in a couple of my feet all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and hated it.
I had that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
<unk>
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture -- because architecture is not about mathematics, and of the division of areas, but of those emotional <unk> -- that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's no wonder that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means when I show you a building like this, I know what they are like, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it by based on a building built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection. We've used this trick for a very, very long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who have <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that are going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library. I ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> has this round of <unk> columns, which leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the stock values the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That one year in 2004, the other side of the country, got another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So, how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's life.
We got <unk> and we gave <unk> so far away from the people.
All of the black -- this is to us, you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and connect with those <unk> symbols here.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start to experiment with <unk> we do swing the door back forward, and over and over again, and we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago in the '70s.
Architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk> scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the <unk> again.
We take those forms that we know like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bake and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't take <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we become a skyscraper, that can be <unk> <unk>
The forms were <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
An madness.
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French, or the Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we are recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know that this is not the <unk>
This is <unk>
Architects are frustrated and we started making swing the <unk> again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
And we had the <unk> symbols now we have new <unk> design techniques, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's <unk>
Normally the translator, <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk> happened.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of those rare moments when I was critical academics and public and public academics were completely familiar with a building.
The New York Times newspaper.
<unk> in Bilbao went up with 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Los Angeles, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wants one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first architect star.
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how it's possible to become ubiquitous across the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms <unk> culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing made the major mayors of the world.
So everyone believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and <unk>
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennials went with other star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few major elite architects on the threshold of new millennium, it actually began to go through the whole architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of it, for example, how we consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next village to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, they can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now that means that the communications speed has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast, and it's moving so fast, because architecture moves so fast, because architecture moves so fast, because architecture moves so fast, because architecture moves so fast, because architecture moves so fast, because architecture moves so fast, because architecture moves so fast, because architecture moves so fast, because architecture moves so fast, because architecture moves so fast, because architecture moves so fast, because architecture moves so fast,
It doesn't really happen a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before we know if the one that I designed about four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we found ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen, because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or steel or an elevator.
So my theory is that when the door applies to the media, it starts to swing through the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, to be on both extremes of <unk> and effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, effectively the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make <unk> symbols with an emotional burden of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building.
This is the center of a town called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community -- and like the drawings seemed exactly to the product -- it was finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and in charge of these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media is not only changed the relationship between us, but that has changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of all, <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> people from <unk> and tell you that there's no unique response to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer like these mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public that doesn't take something that I haven't seen before.
Architects can listen to it, and you don't leave me with the architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one kind of movement to the other, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find the right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
So this means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad China's historical brick historical clip based on ideas that should be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that buildings will be transferred to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage, in Miami Beach, Florida, it also can serve to make sports or <unk> or even one can be married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming on the East <unk> East Side of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community tied around that cause, it's no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> so <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we've built.
Architects already know how to make buildings more intelligent, smarter and more kind.
We've been hoping that all of you want.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot at play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give it way to the more <unk> spaces, local libraries where we formed our children, and the step of the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and it already started walking.
And it makes it that great, typical way of children in a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look in the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and I was like, When do you couple of doing this?
How is it that we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at the Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
He's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because despite his mom telling him all the time she's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells him, and what his friends, or fellow fellow people say, doesn't know who I believe.
So a video of her, he puts it up on YouTube, and he grabs others that please leave a <unk> "I'm nice, or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten more of <unk> comment.
Some of these are so <unk> it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy and normal teenager, and it gets these answers on one of the stages of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today almost never alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> giving up <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never gone.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way -- so young <unk>
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, that will always be connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is changed as well.
What is the most vulnerable thing in somebody's life in front of someone in a day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> still dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture.
It's not hard to see what young people compare to.
But the kids are not immune to this.
It's like the wind stars in sports, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow healthy and be a good individuals.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to their appearance, at the price of all the other other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities -- their studies and other aspects are starting to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls would prefer to do something because they think you don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and how to taxpayers to society and the field of work development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class.
One of five are not coming to classes at all of the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of exams, if you don't think you see you good enough, specifically if you don't think you're good enough, <unk> -- <unk> a lower note at the average of your fellow fellow people who don't care about that in appearance.
And this phenomenon has spread in Finland and China, and China.
It was irrespective of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you're really like.
<unk> on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are less than physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, involved in more diet not healthy that they can take them to a food mess of food.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people who are around and are in higher risk of depression.
And we think this is all about what they make more <unk> decisions like consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic surgery to the early ages and no protection and harm.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether or they have no higher rates of <unk>
High 17 percent of women don't show a job interview in one day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, which would be that argument.
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key steps, the first one is that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are still going to have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that best programs are focused on six key areas, the first one is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are <unk> key points for anyone willing to provide a education in terms of body self-esteem that works.
An education is fundamental but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take all the reins in the issue and be a better model to keep women and girls in our own lives.
Give the current status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in <unk> <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge the people for what they are, not because of the way you see.
All of us can begin by doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and the comments we published in our social networks.
We can advise people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow up to value their entire person, valuing individuality, the <unk>
We need to put the people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be those who come out on the big screen, because we will only create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe they are never going to be the ones who are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who is in mind?
To your <unk>
To your <unk>
To your <unk>
Your <unk> A <unk>
It might be simply the woman who is at two car seats. What would it mean for her if he was released from that voice, he was blown away from that <unk> voice, he was going to be able to have long legs -- <unk> more <unk> a little bit more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were going to take this to it, and we would call it the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession with our culture with images is <unk> to all.
But we will give our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that is the truth that we love them for who are and because of what they do, and because they make it feel.
They put into self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year age today, will become insurance agents in the same morning.
Let's do it.
On November 11, 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> went into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
To <unk> initially meant it innocent it was innocent but being inmate in the young charges in the company of others, started planning attacks to about 12 months from New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
So fortunately, these plans are going to be used by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993, in the World Trade Center, he couldn't get rid of.
He would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a love engineer with an American mother, teacher to elementary school at the age of the two made everything possible for me to give me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam that very few, even most Muslims get to know.
I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to interact with the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all of the human group, there's always a small fraction of people who are going to be so <unk> to their convictions that thinks we have to use all possible media for everyone living as them.
A few months prior to arrest him, he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to <unk> training on Long Island to practice practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my father -- my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained to me how to point to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet who shot him to the little orange light on the goal and to surprise all of us, especially by me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to others and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a father, such a child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But only a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a fly with 700 kilos of explosives in the north park in the North Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability in my childhood, not allowed me to make a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was already time to pack and get another city.
As I was always me the new face of the class often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white one, but to be the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was doing it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I had not developed social skills, to say <unk> to grow under <unk> it wasn't prepared for the real world.
<unk> opera will judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or his religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that put in the test of thinking was during the presidential election election of 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the theme of juvenile violence, like I had been the victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done, I was a Jewish artist.
I took several days out of the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and I really felt very proud to have been able to defeat the barrier that all life had been done to me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush -- a park of <unk>
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
Every life had been taught that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, every gay people were bad <unk>
I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to treat people, exactly in the way I wish to be treated.
And so I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that thing is, but I know what is going to be a little bit beyond my control.
Then they came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me become <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that the race of the people, religion or sexual orientation, don't have anything to do with character.
In a lot of ways he became my <unk> in a moment where I was desperately <unk>
On occasions, inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not no avail.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she said to me something to keep in my heart forever, while she's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much of the negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside of it.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone else is trying to take violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, than even though I was given to this violent ideology of violent ideology, I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved pain and the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism victims, against those endless acts of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I show here as proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or race, which children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
Right now there is a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your weight, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood you project to your eyes.
And there's constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything at all.
This film is your <unk> of consciousness, the subject of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner movie of your own, you and you.
There's nothing to make you more directly.
At least I know I have an consciousness of your own.
I don't have certain that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that are going to be able to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Now, science, for nature, is objective <unk>
<unk> by nature, is subjective <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, you know, that vision.
The psychology was studying <unk> behavior, the neuroscience was studying the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, had very few scientists on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, it all started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work of consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental constraints to the moment.
The center of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of fantastic work that I presented to this guy, Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a science of rules.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience will answer some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to <unk> <unk>
There is actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't tackle the real mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an inner movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon, like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find an explanation.
The classic <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how do you operate the <unk> how they are <unk> are adapting and <unk> the living organisms -- all of them are questions about the target work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the brain functions as a <unk> phenomenon, how we <unk> how we talk about, how we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why it is that all behavior is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, is actually still not much to say.
I'm an <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> which works. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness on pure consciousness that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to get away at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- great. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains some of the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> mad, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
The crazy idea is that there is no such hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective film, includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the brain functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and this is the whole thing that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely artificial consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is free.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time we left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a <unk> brick space, space and mass.
<unk> laws like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any basic terms.
Instead, they think of fundamental ones, and that's what the world is built.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of fundamental concepts -- so long, <unk> law -- so it <unk> the basic laws of the <unk> and it <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- <unk> space, charge, then for a matter of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be, the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science, as well.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, time, the dough, time, the dough, time, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want laws that are so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we have.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> by mind, each system is aware, not only humans, dogs, dogs, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think -- "Oh, I always walk at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of raw feeling -- we will find some early precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How did anyone think about something so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, the time and the dough, is naturally assuming that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is always processing of information, there's consciousness.
<unk> of <unk> complex, like in a human being, a human awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And it's supposed to be able to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a certain degree of information integration -- just like significant awareness of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different <unk> level of <unk>
It actually proposes a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
In addition, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying it.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire coming from?
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave you as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision that puts fire into the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, the <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical implications.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything that I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think it tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information <unk> she has a complicated information processing processing, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a lot of ethical ethical problems on the development of the development of intelligent computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of collective collective consciousness, the planet.
Canada has its own <unk>
Or at a more local level, an integrated group as the audience in a TED Talk, at this point we have a collective consciousness -- a global film for this full TED group, a different movie of the face of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that needs to be taken seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is something fundamental than the second is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those little bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we will finally find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal, one under education.
I went to school, I was obsessed with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to get to a prize for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there is an obvious problem.
She's actually not getting nothing."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as an achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school of <unk> as only after 20 minutes in the class of 11, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What is <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people on chairs. They talk about <unk> things at school?" at the end.
<unk> in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experience with disabled people as inspiration.
And we don't know it, and it's not from the boy, it's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair -- and you probably are waiting for you to do it. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were <unk> in relation to disability.
Yes, you have been sold for the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you fantastic you.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make a fantastic question.
And over the last few years, we have been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before you <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl with no hands drawing with a pen held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with legs of carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn -- because they were going to give a group of people for the benefit of other people.
So in this case, we will be disabled in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that have been tackled by strange <unk> to express that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with disability in the benefit of people without disabilities.
They're there for you that you can see them and think that things aren't that bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
So let's make some things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was inspired by called the social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures too.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies taking away the best of their ability.
So, it's actually just <unk> in the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've been sold for this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't think I am more fortunate than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> of <unk> to collect the things that they fall over --  -- <unk> the clever trick of how to charge the battery of the mobile phone in your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that that lie that we have been sold about disability is the largest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: <unk> in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's a lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disabilities.
A lot of smiles, to a stretch of stairs has never been made to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen will not make the subtitles for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered not <unk> not to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability to be <unk> by getting away from bed and remembering our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a 11-year-old boy at a high school in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that her new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
disability does not make us <unk> but questioning what you know to know what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to do augmented reality and football -- with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just to answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> your hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> the Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I attempt to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would do with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running by the field of game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a man is that a man of 110 pounds would tell us about trying to <unk> them with all of them.
I've been there and I assure you that it's nothing nice.
<unk> some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the hull, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> of the emerging technology is a submarine rising to the surface.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A little bit of a moment. <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling of being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, will be your favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get into <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many people know.
<unk> Rift has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why with this video.
Man: Oh, yeah.
No, no, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian rollercoaster by his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball into the bottom of the network?  Or you can make a <unk> in <unk>
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve <unk> <unk>
It will augmented reality by <unk> when <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a brief refresher on the technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> <unk> put a <unk> to his <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed on the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the <unk>
They were more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that it's a player coming back to your group, and you see your next thing that you see in front of you, in a plastic <unk> that they carry in front of you, you don't have to worry about to forget a <unk>
or to memorize the strategy.
Just go into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want him because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties to you as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way of playing the game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the carbon sensors and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is being sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad people will have <unk>
This is going to make the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the analytics of data will stop being <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
I would make the ball and <unk>
They put an open license, all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you normally don't know it, but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
<unk> the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open vote.
<unk> the <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where they land, and the receptor sees in your bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and you can modify the race.
They <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The audience mad, and the fans have followed the same way from each angle.
This is something that will create massive emotion in the game.
So I'm going to do that many people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to boost empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad your actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it also for a <unk> <unk> or <unk> Neil <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than <unk> and <unk> notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as long as we are.
Thank you.
I was <unk> after 23 years of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago I was <unk> the end of the South County <unk> which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure known to its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring style style of it.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who would build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much after <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from opening up, more than 1,600 people have jumped into their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been displayed as such, so that each of it frees you away from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to make suicide.
After one four to five seconds, the body hits water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of which we would have vital organs.
Most of the impact.
The ones that wasn't, normally <unk> in the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think the ones that <unk> this suicide method will realize the death of the death <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to take their life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark, it's very difficult to bring you back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
They were able to pick up the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who died suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, business officials and psychologists train the new government companies.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at 22 July 22 year when he was getting a call from a possible person sitting at the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to Jason talking with a officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and I had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were actually flown up with two times before from New Jersey to try to suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent the Earth to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity was able to <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out and <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So then Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped some <unk> leaned on the right, and they left.
This guy and smart kid in New Jersey had just taken your life.
I spoke to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day the next day, I was called the family rabbi called me to see how she was.
The parents of Jason had been order.
<unk> damage affects a ton of people.
So I'm telling you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What do you do?
So what does it mean?
In my experience, you don't only have to talk about, but you need to listen to me.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person who you know how it feels like because they probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, let's think about how much circumstances have thought to end your life, you've had these <unk>
They would give up the person in front of it can save life and be the turning point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing that you can do with <unk> social isolation, and a losing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son in January of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and blessing who I read it.
Boy: <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking, I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments of realization that Mike won't come home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father 19 of January.
It never came there.
I knocked on the police of <unk> and <unk> as a disappeared night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported that the car car was down in the bridge.
A witness I'd seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without suffering a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your struggle.
The Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, to a radio call for a possible person in the bridge <unk> near the northern tower.
I put my motorcycle on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me, he immediately came up with the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and a half later, I heard as Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day back on that lane and give it another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What was it that he did, and you gave him for hope and life again.
And you know what he told me.
He said, "I'm <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Soon after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that card with me, and I would like to give it to you.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the March <unk> events and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
<unk> Kevin when I was only six months old, completely unconscious of all those traits -- <unk> but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes -- <unk> When I visited St. General San Francisco at the night, you were <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I know I had to do it.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk>
That act, despite finishing their own pain, gives me the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people, or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want their own chest pain.
Normally this is achieved only three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
And for that time, I joined the hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact on the bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few people have jumped from the bridge and lived and can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that leave the railing they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be able to be able to be able to be able to do to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question: How do you get in that?
I have to be something in that sense, but I'm not alone, but I'm not alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever had since a little girl.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, that I'm going to go over later, when I look at this photo, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the past stage I discovered is, <unk> I'm getting started.
We all care about our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the beliefs of those who are around us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, I had no even ignored my story.
I think this enigma is called revelation.
This is mine.
They signed me as <unk> as I was born, because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt in my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you all wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, is my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, actually, it's more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never encouraged myself to share my story, not because I thought to be what I'm a bad thing, but how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank you every day thank you to be female.
I have a mama, my dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, and this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still in a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was responsible for the overhead to <unk> and everyone -- and that night, I won in the bathroom, he won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> between over 40 candidate ends.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was a Queen of beauty of women <unk> but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I was <unk> to provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than all of that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, he called me and I told me that my request from the green card that could go to live in the U.S.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a Queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you ask the America to be able to change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to listen to.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She also stayed with me when I was inspired by Thailand in Thailand the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At that time in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before it changed the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license, with the name <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears were <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York City who had lived his truth, but he was able to put it back to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
And all 20 of November, we make a global height, by the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day there is no longer than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you do?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> first to thank all of my <unk>
I support my support network, especially my family, which is really very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been calling women young people who have been called, and some times, when I were called me and they told me that her parents couldn't take it, and I would take the phone, he called my mom and he said, "Mommy, can you please call this <unk>
Sometimes it works, others don't. It's just our gender identity, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender to be born, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table the theme that sometimes that task is not block, and there should be a space that would allow people, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope all of you will be my allies.
KS: Thank you. <unk> <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, the parents generally know about their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started their rights campaign by defending their rights in 2007. And when he opened their efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National Prize <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I would take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies, right from the beginning, when a child, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome, no for his father, and for his mother.
The neighborhood comes, gives her <unk> to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother was going to get a lot for a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> her third daughter, he feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only do Mother <unk> but the daughter <unk> <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At age five years, when I should go to school, it's left home and school admits the brothers.
Until the age of 12 years, somehow, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you sell him to go out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turns into the so-called honor of her father and his brothers and his family, and if we were <unk> the code of that honor, and it might even kill.
And it's interesting that this of the honor code doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of the course of honor.
And there's one more rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl to be very <unk> very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and it accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly even if it doesn't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if I had the <unk> with an old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
What happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to their children.
And this vicious circle goes on, and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And so much before I was going to go out of his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so on.
But when I was told, they were all men, and I grabbed my feather, and <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was about four and a half years old, I was in my school.
You might wonder, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yes, I must <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in <unk> societies in tribal societies, is a great event that for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means about your identity and your name.
One message to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspiration and the aspiration where their potential can be in their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when we were able to make the form of Newton -- Canadian and was in the relative of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for the value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to see the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to do it in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys for the same.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, I'll forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, paid for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we had a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned going to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and lifted up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog blog of the BBC, she was offered her as to the New York Times, and I spoke on every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and December 7, 2012, <unk> to <unk> in his head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he gave my ear to my wife and "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
They will raise your life for the cause of truth, because of the peace cause, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both of them were on the right path and God <unk>
These little words would take a lot for me, and I didn't go back again.
When <unk> was in the hospital and he had a strong severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow of the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to say, "I am okay with my smile, and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
<unk> when he doesn't run his homework.
They fight her siblings, and I'm very happy about that.
People ask me, "What is special about my <unk> who has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
I didn't do what I did.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently recently joined the Google Map, from Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm going to talk today about the science of the brain, I did before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you hit a brain surgery.
You're still just like smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you'll be <unk>
After <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the dead <unk> part of the center that creates a major hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mixtures of chemicals, and try to get them to stay alive.
More than I've been saved by a time.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would be able to get the <unk> dose, because there really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to test with different mixtures -- and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the dose, dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I do, my sense of thinking about my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried doses and standard chemicals for an early man, and I was surprised to see how my thoughts <unk>
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sexual activity, and I believed that it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turns out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was able to have a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that he had in front of it, and it just wasn't going to happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and what they have to do -- since then I take me better with men.
What I was trying to do about to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking -- my ideas of ideas.
So you know, thinking almost always in images, and that became my key reference point how to do these mental imaging that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> as <unk> Descartes and <unk> saw things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the brain works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to thinking and <unk>
So after a number of years, I got to find the point right now and I have already lots of great <unk> mental <unk> really, really sophisticated and well <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a director of cinema was able to use its imagination only to drive the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There's amazing possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply increasing the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI and functional MRI resonance to represent the brain here, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The column of the middle shows the scan of that same individual the same individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created by the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This <unk> in many different individuals with a lot of different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They brought the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's go through this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a large set of reactions to the brain sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new, new people, new animals, and as long as it was <unk> a new <unk>
And the computer using just the brain data from the scan of the scan to show you what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew up to us.
We're right about doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at a picture and when you imagine that same image, you can imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the largest scanning scanning systems that are available today, and their resolution was a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening the skull and put electrodes.
I don't offer myself for that.
Many are proposing new techniques of projection for images, even me, <unk> with the recent result of MRI -- first we have to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom is that the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets but at this point, magnets had only small improvements in the resolution, not gains for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea, instead of bigger magnets make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort effort on MRI was to make magnets really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever solutions and brilliant solutions and <unk> in the tiles and radio frequency frequency in MRI systems, in MRI.
And instead of a magnetic field -- instead of a magnetic field is able to ignore magnetic patterns structured -- the frequencies of radio <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing of radio processing, we can increase in massive form of information that can be extracted in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide our rising knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
As we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid -- but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and maybe even neural neural activity, this is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas on a direct way to the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would be <unk>
And how do you learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> use as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more choices to open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it'll take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
His closet, maybe is to tell some person for the first time that he loves it, or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to put in life.
Everything I looked at is a hard conversation and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and out of that closet.
Day fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits <unk> the letters of <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And so I'm going to be <unk> by the <unk> of my little little <unk> and I had <unk> my head <unk> I would usually ask a little kid to say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there'd be a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I got my jaw a little bit more, and it would take me a little bit of my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother got a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and I would go through it.
And I came to the point that every time I was going to a little kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that the next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a kid or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was ready to get away with the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
The <unk> <unk>
Even an excerpt from the "Vagina Monologues,"
And so I took it deep down, and I went down to my backs a little girl in four years with a pink dress looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with one question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so I took it up again, I got back on <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a mess.
I have the short hair like a kid, and I saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and I just like you to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable traditions.
I am more than the kind of girl in a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was everything. "Oh, you are a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl from <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how a feeling feels like living in a closet.
It's like my closet, it's not different from yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you 100 reasons why it comes out of my closet was more difficult than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who has declared online online is harder than saying that it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult than telling your five year-old son that you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, just the hard thing.
We need to stop growing, what we need to stop thinking about what hard for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must only feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what their walls are made of their walls, and it's not a place to live in.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
Dirt <unk> I had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian <unk> to fight any <unk> who would walk the coffee.
He was frozen in the fear of fear -- in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, and the move just a muscle is the scariest thing that I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends, fully strangers who I've spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was going back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade shuttle was in my sister <unk>
It was the first time that many people were invited in, they knew it was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> and <unk> and I walked around the tables and finally came around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to ask me.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women cried to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay account of the gay story.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in St. <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
"You know, what's your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will and Grace program.
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting to show you desperately their support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is wearing a <unk> shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and tell the fact that they were <unk>
And what else is you going to ask somebody, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you are.
It's like the hard conversations still remain my strong point.
Ask anybody that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of anything is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others need to know that we do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  give the complex things.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can be injured safe, <unk> by what they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel like that, but that is something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not for you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you have to know that we've been there before.
And it might be very familiar with them, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen -- an productive example has been famous <unk> quote that "The question of if a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical to the pioneers of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I had a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental core mechanisms of intelligence.
Go forward a walk.
So let's start with a thought experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race -- that you don't know anything about the biology of Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly large lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until some time at the time, the asteroids that we would put on the surface of a planet -- let me do it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that the natural nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, to a single underlying underlying mechanism.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be replicated, to development for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states, which are <unk> the diversity of future future.
Finally, at the planning of robotic movement planning there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, by taking all of these different themes and <unk> together, I asked, for several years ago, there is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's just a equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is an F force, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open options with a T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yes, up to an imminent time, <unk>
In short, intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the options.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the standard of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have trend conditions to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection to the entropy and the intelligence and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy production, but actually it comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that can be found.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple experimental intelligence testing, play games, and even make money <unk> <unk> actions, all of it without being done to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human foot here, we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave you a goal.
He just decided to figure out the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for <unk> robotic technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
And also, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite ends with a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This ability for cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
So for example, here successfully play a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for the game.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the poor net network.
This is the same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering it in success and using the Panama Canal to extend the world in the world to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we can spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of <unk> negotiation -- successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have huge applications in finance, in secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walk upright and social cooperation -- all derived from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if you were really smart machines -- they would have a <unk> rebellion, in the use.
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that perhaps all these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion, in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, "How do you look for goals of this kind of <unk>
So my statement to that statement to move to the descendants of them to help them build artificial artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence is this: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a turning point in human history, something between the appearance of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've extended our knowledge to how it fits Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points around other stars, which points to the Earth is only one of the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a Space telescope that measures the intensity of the faint <unk> of stars when the planets go in front of them, and they block a little bit of that light that will go.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of the planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their star star.
And together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their grasp.
In turn, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are livable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds that are potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, it was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since millennia, are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused to a global scale have been very quickly <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I am not a scientist of climate, no <unk>
But I study <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone really interested in pursuit of life in the universe can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, the more I enjoy our own planet.
Every single one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the only planet, and the planets that we know -- the world of our solar system.
Take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further away from the sun, can be a potentially livable world, shown this for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past and part of it that is why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> they are tracking its surface in search clues about the origins of life as we know it.
So the satellites of the <unk> and the <unk> mission, they take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies are now providing not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all these <unk> images remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain by <unk> places that are actually compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places on Earth, air is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this kind of excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets coming out with a great and sad <unk> and belief and belief in some that Mars would expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable the Earth.
And so I like <unk> exploration, I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there for humanity to look at humanity is like imagine the captain of the Titanic will comment on the top of the Titanic going to get place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and land preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile and <unk> spaces of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an <unk> experiment.
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, having in account that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence for alien life for now.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become very advanced advanced enough to consider to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we can develop this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization we need to save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I had no keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the dining table, where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows and all of them were very closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to pass night because he had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I was <unk> from my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive -- but surely it doesn't get more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, even though the <unk> worked very well.
I'm a couple of profession, and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> who goes up the heart rate -- <unk> the adrenaline levels and <unk>
And when I got to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I had no passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in his place, which would be made bad things that would happen.
Or at least if it happens, bad things -- that you need the probability of it to be a total catastrophe of it.
So I got to think about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't get to.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner and a little bit embarrassed I talked about the Nobel Prize, and a little bit embarrassed I told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been doing something called hindsight hindsight
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then tries to figure out what can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so apparent.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, I would have a place for the things that are losing very easily.
This sounds like common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to get track of the location of the important things, where the same is, where the fish are, the places that the trees are <unk> where the tribes live, and they live in <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find their nuts.
And if you wonder if someone really did the experiment, the <unk> sense of the <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism evolved in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that are moving a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car, <unk> and <unk>
So in the house I took a place for the keys, a boat hook along the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For his passport, a particular drawer in it.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they're <unk> with that stuff always will be there when you <unk> them.
What about <unk>
Take with the cell phone a picture of your credit cards, licensed <unk> <unk> <unk> for mail to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
So remember, when you're under stress, your brain frees up cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation that when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one to be wanted to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the decisions and in fact for the decision-making of financial and social choices, any kind of decision that we need to take out of the one that would benefit from the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol result is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease attack to the heart <unk>
So you are thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug to help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe one has already heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even likely you can know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you have to do then, a question that you must ask for the most physicians that most physicians don't want to talk about, and the companies companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's a fault of somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood that very well <unk>
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help an person?
300.
This is the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> independently <unk>
I will explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a heart heart heart attack, or another event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one in 300 to <unk> my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic and it is, <unk> of the effects of <unk> Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects produce in five percent of patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they're thinking, "The five percent are not very likely to happen to me, even how to take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how we do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has taken five percent of the 300 -- have a side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your doctor.
<unk> medical ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take your risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of crash, but actually this necessary number to try and is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the greatest men of the largest cancer <unk> the number necessary to try to be <unk>
So, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, is produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky -- and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only only take a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you might argue that we will go through the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice, many times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a healthier life that might have a lot of pain at the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> to face with a predator, it doesn't need the solar system or the <unk> or your immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get to be the lions of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thought that Danny <unk> and their colleagues have been shown.
So we have to be able to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail to time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help us minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor in a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the entry door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't read it.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- I never have a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade of 1800, and over the time of time, they mixed with local signs and the language was filled with the language that we know today as <unk>
So, it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, really are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a computer world -- it's like I lived in a foreign country, following some of your rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound begin?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people answers.
So I've learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat from the bag of chips <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure they didn't have the <unk> in the <unk>
This is all called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting with <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
It's going to keep going.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see the <unk> no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain sound through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
<unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, doing this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked as <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now sound has gone into my territory of art.
It goes to me more from art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all that had been taught in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, it was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a kind of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art work, or I could help me.
I chose to give me <unk>
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like no voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as to become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the school, and the institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask for <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a form of value that is like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to do it at <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound as my new artistic medium -- I would go in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor for the piano to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> is <unk> in many different different parameters
If you <unk> a different <unk> for every finger while you touch the piano, like the facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and like that, as you get the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if you were <unk> just one key to the time.
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in a place to express a clear concept or an idea of <unk>
If only one switch would change the chord would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with the music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters you can express different ideas.
For example, the signature sign in that."
This is the sign sign in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I got to think, and if I look at <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and you put it over and again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
So for example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and take it.
This is all the day."
If you <unk> it and <unk> the visually speed, you see it as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said of <unk> the <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance into the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is a long time -- a lot of time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time -- <unk> one again."
<unk> <unk> is a music term with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Look at your right hand right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do this with me?
All of the hands in high tall.
Now we're going to do it so much in the head like chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as an <unk> is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please try it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
So look at how three signs are very similar. They all occur in the head and chest -- but they transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how <unk> live and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And perhaps people understand that you don't have to be disabled to learn <unk> not that you have to hear about music.
The <unk> is a rich commodity, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to give you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you take it out, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a waking bubble or a bubble of ignorance I mean, because adults lie to us to protect ourselves from the awful truth.
When I was getting older, I learned that adults also <unk> and they're not very good at cleaning each other from others.
Time country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizenship and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk on the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's scary.
And over the last decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, and we collect these plastic pieces to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and we put them into this information on a map.
But it lasts to an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge ships.
So together with my students, with six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> work with <unk> so that kids are very <unk> they can also participate in.
And I will say, kids who manipulate electrical tools are really cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try and take the best ideas of every child and try to get it into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic just <unk> information.
And by using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the children are going to get a lot with the robots.
We then created what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we can transform light up and web cameras on your tracks and put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board is going to process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a similar estimate of how much plastic in the water.
<unk> this <unk> invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would get it even further.
The great thing in this project is that the students saw a local and <unk> problem, they're trying to fix it immediately.
I can investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
You see the news, <unk> the Internet -- and you get away with this image: right?
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, only using the hands in <unk> the largest largest rainforest, in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is going to fall into the water where the water will live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and oil is also brown brown and when it's <unk> it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> that can lead through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help you identify what's in the water.
So let's put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the other children.
I saw a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe I will address a harder problem, and also closest to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he started a lot of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power plant in the water.
And today, according to the reports of an average of 300 tons is still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation was disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and the most most of the time, and the most of the time, is a safe blue thing.
Well, it's a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the crash and research accident, with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course, not the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here is the use of <unk>
It might seem like they did not do work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all your life.
Together with them we discussed the data that we discussed that day and talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the <unk> <unk> map to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And with this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust were <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition over close to the nuclear power to date.
We are approaching a mile of nuclear power and with the support of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should get the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became so much small so we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and became the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically, you can build almost almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with <unk>
So for example.
Or do we help in the mobility age mobility transforming their standard wheels into new self-driving cars.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We cannot afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, <unk> <unk> <unk> we have to prepare the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one of the silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is <unk> on the environment, the other thing thought it did.
One is designed by nature, the other thing.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the marble <unk> he saw a figure that is fighting for being free.
<unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we carry all the information for each cell to work and for <unk>
The tools have also consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> manufacturing and mass production.
The lines of assembly have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> of <unk> parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with microscopic <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts primarily like filter the other mainly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that goes gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a <unk> screen that represents my view of the world <unk> the double personality of the world -- the <unk> personality and an organism, between the <unk> and the organism, between assembly and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere.
My work, at the most simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, raising the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourself, why now?
Why couldn't this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they have four disciplines that are giving designers access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds of my students.
We're designing objects, products, products, structures and tools on the scale of a large scale, like this robotic arm with a degree of the diameter with a base of the ground that some day not very distant to print <unk> and graphic buildings to the nanoscale facts of genetically <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every opening is unique size to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion <unk> with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second <unk> skin of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and read 3D <unk> without the cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This <unk> combines rigid materials and <unk> at the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner scanner.
So designers have access to this high resolution and <unk> instruments that are able to design products that are <unk> not only the way of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustics, of a acoustics, a chair to the same time, comfortable and also that absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and when we design this surface of the surface <unk> it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the data points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, they make their functionality not through addition to other material or other <unk> but <unk> continually and <unk> the material.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't have raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them got stuck and it came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God send to Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of <unk>
Instead, the land made trees grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world in the place.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design of the design of a single part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material to do the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of being produced every year because of the shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune their properties, we could generate structures that could be able to make <unk> structures on one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We asked a bunch of <unk> <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk>
We had chemical concentrations -- we've been able to get a wide range of properties, from the dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures on a large scale, it built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could actually vary the properties of the material and to create these structures made of one material, three feet long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, you can dry it off to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> that first showed up on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria in the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition from no problems of <unk> to mesh, and if it broadens even more, on windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Was it working with a old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water biology, and we have transformed a structure made of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects that are designed for <unk> <unk> in the sea, <unk> life in the ground, will help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain life for <unk>
To do that, we must master the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> table, we made our own table of <unk> new forms of life created by <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just as instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new basic functionalities inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We would have our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, they were <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and on the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that changed in the human intestine.
One becomes the light in sugar, the other <unk> sugar and produces useful periods for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, not interact in nature.
In fact, it's never been <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the tract <unk> which will help you bring these bacteria and to make their function of way.
So we started making those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to <unk> functionality in the world.
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> channels more transparent.
This digestive system, when you stretch from one end to another, it goes 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut thin.
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels in your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are the middle creatures of fashion -- only half is <unk>
What if the design would provide the other <unk>
What if we could create structures that will increase your matter will <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin <unk> the tissue harmed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home inside which is <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers to each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, it creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet, to the head of a silk worm <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the silk worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that you would have a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different environments, different <unk> and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the <unk> the <unk> structure was transmitted directly through the environment.
You often get <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it uses the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we could shape <unk> <unk> without boiling <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we raised this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> doing silk, and we put us in our site.
We knew that silk worms are going to be more dark and <unk> and so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, stretch the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
We asked the silk worms to a online silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the bottom of the <unk> and as you go, <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts from again, like us, but much, much more short of us.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk on the silk <unk> <unk> give all this <unk> its integrity.
And in a little bit of two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk path.
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> is through a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is giving life to the products and the buildings around us to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
It brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature inspired by the first time, which demands us, for the first time that we do charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what old people were when they asked them for the first time.
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety of anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school, I liked the English and the arts and the art and I developed websites, and I was playing the guitar, in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I get struck by something else, which is totally different, and I was excited about it, and I was going to get out of it, and I feel <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to find something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that made me so much anxiety was a little bit more <unk>
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something bad in me would not do anything for me.
I was concerned about engagement, or to be dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something I'd like to get back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they learned from culture.
So we ask a first question: "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were doing at that age.
This is considered a naive question to create cute responses in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question makes us again and again as we grow in a different time -- <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens from being the nice exercise before you take the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired to kids to dream with what they might be, not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite. Because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though well-intentioned things, maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor became <unk> <unk> a professor and a <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they will have to choose from.
But it is more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of the destination or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something that is going to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and I'll dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different themes that bring up your curiosity and lots of different things that wants to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> to say.
It could help if you divide it into three <unk> and potential <unk>
You can also use other terms that <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance the first of the Renaissance the ideal was the one who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
They have any term that you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as any limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned from talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests shared in cartography, visualization data, travel, mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk> <unk>
To <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea of his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
From there comes the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their feet, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second <unk> <unk> is a rapid learning.
When we were <unk> we are interested in it.
We are looking at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to test new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are attached to other disciplines, and we bring all of what we have learned to each new area that we have rarely started from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a child pianist, an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer, I was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales of sales when they started their practices and that ability to write compelling tosses for the editors.
I rarely have a loss of time to be a loss of time to go to the end of it, even if you end it up.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could have no longer <unk>
The third <unk> <unk> is the adaptability. So the ability to transition into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other Internet designer, sometimes blog from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> Company Company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas -- quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're a <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster people to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart <unk>
<unk> from the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The programmers can dive deep down and put in practice -- ideas and <unk> offers a width of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are connected to how we're connected.
And unfortunately, in the <unk> in large parts are <unk> to just be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there is one thing that you can take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then <unk> all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Follow their curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk> us.
Thank you.
In the year I had a woman named <unk> they took it to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until that, unfortunately, died in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If I had been living today, we couldn't give her more help to her more aid than the one that I was going to have was a few years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in getting a diagnosis we now call disease. disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've been discovered and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, drug for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But gradually it has moved through Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the chance for Alzheimer's is going to be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that they are going to spend their teenage years with Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or being dear disease.
In America, health care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care spend on disease disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs of five times in the year 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be predicted to cure or even slow down.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer cancer than Alzheimer's cancer in spite of the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time you know, but everyone else is going to do -- Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of the last few years, all scientists, in fact, scientists, Alzheimer's disease, with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just have to look at a picture of a picture of a healthy brain compared to the one of an Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental abilities, the damage to the Alzheimer's disease is reduces by Alzheimer's life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For nearly a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as origami.
There are places in the role that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these points are <unk> end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There's a lot of steps, and the identification of how much block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
You know, a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we did, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, mostly the wires have reduced the wires and waiting for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> physical, engineers and mathematics.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that centers specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos from what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick into each other of them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive results, but research like this sample that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince them that Alzheimer's is a disease, and if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry, and <unk>
That was essential to progress on HIV treatment in the late 80s.
Today we see that same unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Humanity is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the Middle York Times column in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when we test it by the night of the summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: -- these strangers are <unk> to get <unk> more and more personal questions, and then you both look at your eyes without talking about four minutes.
So here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you would ask another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner -- what you like to do, or she was, I know very truthful this time, and I gave the things that you wouldn't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really famous detail that two of the participants had ever married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to be <unk>
However, we were <unk> and  And I thought it was a good story, so I thought I was a good story, so I would send it to the Middle Bang.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably asking you to go together.
And the reason I think I'll be questioning this is because they've done this question over and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
One week before I was published the paper was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand of it.
And that came a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night at night, and on Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And Sunday Sunday, they had a call <unk> Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got more than eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing it in terms of bare experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called a little bit of it, what they did every day for weeks, they were always doing the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I took a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> keep <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were students and journalists and strangers and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
But I had a talk, and a woman was scared until the stage, "Hey, <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately became red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first drive to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that both of us did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> the orders of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons of <unk> of the process of <unk> -- a range of which I didn't feel like I was at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked -- they wanted to know if I was able to produce <unk> or so, if I was able to produce love -- not only an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship had just a few months, and I felt, especially that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if you were doing it together or not, and they are also <unk>
If the answer was no, it would make the experience of doing these 36 questions that are less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this particular study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for <unk> <unk> among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
Participants were felt more close to doing so many later several studies, and they were also used as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community -- and they used it used between people with <unk> <unk>
The original version of history, the one I tried last summer, that combine personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and he told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> by it.
And I said, you want to say that you love you from the person with whom you <unk>
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
I said, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's love.
I stumbled across the first time when I was 29 -- and I was going through a really difficult separation of a really difficult study.
He had that relationship since I had 20, what I was mostly supposed to be 20, and he was my first real love, and he had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I was on science.
I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected it to be able to make the heart <unk>
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I was only research on the book that I write -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel as bad as I was then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in a way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than you reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for for love is a guarantee -- not only to be <unk> today, and it's going to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to be <unk> because of the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media said about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There might be a way for some ways to mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that I ask, still still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let's ask us to ask questions like, how do we decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a well-known study -- and we applied a study that is designed to create romantic love, we are going to tell us still together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing that remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my journal <unk> The love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love because we take the choice to be.
And I shudder a little bit to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I had not considered everything I was supposed to think about that choice.
I wasn't expecting how many times we would have to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he was always going to pick up or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded for 36 questions, having chosen to love someone as generous, and fun and expressed that choice in the largest newspaper newspaper.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think of it.
And what we're going to do, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is.
I want the happy end to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is a chance to choose somebody, and the hope that he also love, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few <unk> and I was raised in the mountain in a way -- I got a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York City does a while.  One thing that really affected me but more details on it.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
It took a box of wood, and you would take a dollar bill a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some weird <unk> or a few aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
In a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like going seat and <unk> and all those <unk> things, and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took out all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style of Agnes Martin, the covered of resin and a bee became <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid to bees, and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened in the opposite: in some way it looks like that it increased as much as it increased as if it was that you could put the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding some electronic elements, frogs strange bottles that I was finding out on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
Can I be able to draw <unk> drawing just like a <unk> on the scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens at it.
First, I mean, you might be able to make an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, <unk> <unk> of natural size of human beings in the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
So I started drawing on the glass layers similar to the drawing on one window, and then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows that become a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really works, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For <unk> I inspired me in a big measure in "The garden of <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the <unk> Museum in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Five meters long.
It has a double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They are out of the world of representation, with this <unk> mesh <unk> where they were <unk>
Here's where the creatures with animals are run by the <unk> lists for suicide in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god strapped to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> El <unk> -- the <unk> platform of <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of rare things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand gets a clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit of an narrative.
So that's the hand that we <unk>
And then when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird, of a bird's <unk> and spitting out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail.
Anyway, his tail turn fire into the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go, you know.
Her tail end up in a balloon <unk> balloon made of terrorist cards.
Have you <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball baseball cards.
Very <unk> over time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six years ago to make 100 of these human beings.
Each is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of a human being, and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 or 12 at the time.
They are like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm carrying years.
Each is basically a <unk> <unk> that weighs 1.3 pounds of a <unk> human inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest is <unk> the <unk>
I'm going to play you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers it or <unk> or whatever it has, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see it.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There's some pills that go out and go into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
They can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there's a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a school, a school arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people in hits each other with the particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, the concepts of the countries, of religion, in religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through your stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective and most effective system for any <unk> drug in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take <unk> drugs, these serve to decrease the amount of virus in the blood, and increase the pulse of stem cells.
But they are also known for their side effects on their most negative, because in time that it takes you to get to the current stream -- it will be <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it's more important in the HIV pump.
These are regions of the body like the lymph population, the nervous system, the nervous system, the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily in the blood stream of patients who are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells <unk>
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that are a treatment for life run by the day.
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "Do you make the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you use it to be used to <unk> for wounds and surgery disease, they can be used for anything else <unk> including transportation <unk>
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open up or <unk> extremely small holes that open and closed almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best you ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser beam on the cellular membrane infected with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can <unk>
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, he runs into the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a long time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total total of the HIV of the body.
Yeah. It's a cure for HIV.
This is the <unk> dream of all the <unk> in our case, a little laser treatment.
Thank you.
Over the last decade, I've been studying <unk> groups like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these U.S. agents from violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to the confrontation of violent <unk>
I do a field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-governmental actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975. And 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a government non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have to be able to <unk> or <unk> in any kind of resolution of state conflicts.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they are doing it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
<unk> fight and the political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known by their violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a social service network, and a military system.
In the same way, Palestinian <unk> known by their suicide attacks against Israel -- it also runs <unk> in Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking things.
<unk> a complex communication machinery radio stations radio channels, TV channels and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the print magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising of funding without <unk> but by doing business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their <unk> increase their <unk> to recruit and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, they put hospitals, put online training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population of offering something that the state don't have security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a Afghanistan separating by war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also be able to understand the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security is about a year ago in the population of the population.
But in general, providing social services that means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap in the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 on the Palestinian Hamas cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps <unk> by the government, and they emerge as armed and political groups participate in the violent struggle and provide governance.
And the more sophisticated and more sophisticated things are these organizations, we can <unk> it as opposed to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
They were part of a landscape, running all of their functions. collect the trash, which is the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, and we live with no state and hybrids and the weak of the states, as in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap the <unk> actors <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the U.S. tools.
<unk> that gap of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important also to establish and put peace.
If we understand better groups -- we understand better what incentives to provide the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, the military power can win some <unk> but we won't give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security, to fill that safety gap.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid accepting openly the tag of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I kind of struck me as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then on interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and at 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> sex as if that was something bad.
Today, I see how they're treated all over the world and our anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> who could be feminist.
Being labeled a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty.
I would tell me as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which begs too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it is the same or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, some claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same job for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use it easy and accessible the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We are not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our own social condition and a lot more.
We have to have to realize these differences and how we care about the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music -- you hear any volume.
Although the letter degrades women and it offends me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of yin yang is incredible.
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you gave you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical personality.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do to do, <unk> --  all of the <unk> but also killing insects -- and <unk> <unk> <unk> and maintenance out of it.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and the nice stuff.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic <unk> from the <unk> stories that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, is her choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise her children, I agreed that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> in a way that makes women economically vulnerable when they were born.
I would have this problem.
<unk> the conventional Feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically, the needs of women of color, and gay workers, favor of white, <unk> <unk> <unk> and high <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist <unk>
It also happens to the following: <unk> <unk>
We have this tendency to put feminists <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we hope it is perfection.
When we were <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where <unk>
As I said, I am a <unk> I consider myself to get this <unk> before I try to get there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a fear of fear that it means that it was a fear of fear that it would not be able to get the little realistic expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
Over the last few years is a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music Review 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show, looking at this star from the pop star embracing feminism and to know women and the young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started endless discussions if they were or not precisely feminist.
They had their job instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We go far beyond the sensible criticism of <unk> and <unk> to make feminism of any female, <unk> until it was nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or more good, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to pass the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy that happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change its way to talk about women in their songs until we make their change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify the worst choice.
But when bad decisions justify this that makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and our responsibility.
I think of three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
And they are going to tell you about the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as a sport, <unk> the <unk> play.
We can change the radio plate when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than as a <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers, and <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men, particularly heterosexuals can say, "No, I'm not going to publish my magazine, participating in your project, or work with you, until you have no number enough enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of <unk>
Those of us who are <unk> but they were going to engage participate in this kind of projects, we can also be able to be able to be even more even more than we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision.
Because we are no longer <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, and our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions get to the top, to the people in the power of CEOs and cinema and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create lasting change and significant change.
We can also tell with bravery our job -- well, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say it about everything, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to do what happened.
A couple of kids asked me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started believing it was nothing.
I had my voice, and after all of it didn't bother to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I would give me a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked at me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it wasn't nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing, and I also found that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other one, I have a hopeful reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same.
I hope we can all be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California, they had <unk> for having visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with an <unk> immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There is a effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the outbreak that had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that's supposedly supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that captured the argument on autism and the European vaccines, disqualified and marked by being a <unk> fraud for British Medical School.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of fathers around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rising estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very bizarre disease.
The few psychologists and how many psychologists had heard about she believed to develop all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates were getting stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
The fundraising companies such as <unk> <unk> is referred to routinely by autism as an epidemic as if I could call it another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who searches in the face of his son of two years, the eye contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to <unk> why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at <unk> Johns Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to have a private worlds, <unk> the people around me, including their own parents.
They could fun for hours by shaking their faces, but they were engaged from panic by <unk> as when he didn't put their favorite toy in his usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the 1950s, as the major authority of the world in the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as <unk> references from places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, we will give that diagnosis to children with temporal disease, but now we know that the epilepsy is very common in autism.
It was once <unk> that he'd become nine of every 10 children sent by other doctors to their doctor's office without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold fathers and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have kept very carefully in a fridge that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I get the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite records and he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the kids were just simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents who were dying to win their approval approval by getting their approval further.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, turning it into invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s -- that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, thought that the theory of mothers <unk> <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was warm and warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as owned without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Service Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith <unk> decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a autism prevalence study in the general population.
<unk> a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse that the reality of autism was a lot.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, or in the <unk> of <unk>
In the way, these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> as he said, <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model, would have predicted predicted.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of your data.
How did no one not realized these children before?
But then I found out, I found a reference to a newspaper article published in German <unk> the year after the <unk> article -- and then he got <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in their own work.
There was no translation to the English English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was doing it for her.
The document is offering an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinical clinic with a school in Vienna in Vienna in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music exercises with music, and the kids were still their games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described described as a disabled disability of life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and he was going to help the development of education methods that were particularly appropriate for them.
<unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that included a surprising variety of wedding and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He went beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '90s, and the early '90s, their changes went into <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> by a broad and produced <unk>
These changes didn't fell into a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult a first time.
Before I came out, <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, and parents around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes on the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses began to <unk> as predicted as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact hoping that it was, making the people with autism and their families finally <unk> support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by the increase in the diagnostics. A simple, powerful, <unk> story as bad as the <unk> theory of autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children are in the spectrum, it's right in the spectrum, the autistic ones are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
Over the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that are the puzzles to solve by the new medical advances, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way of understanding <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC is not working with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> <unk> and suffer from a attention deficit to detail.
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we are still reaching <unk> which creates the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding the teachers, employers who are with capacity, community communities, and the parents of faith in the potential for their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of <unk>
As we go to a uncertain future, we need all of the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
